<h1>4 Robustness</h1> <p>Several things are wrong with the messenger example in <code><a href="conc_prog#ex">A Larger Example</a></code>. For example, if a node where a user is logged on goes down without doing a logoff, the user remains in the server's <code class="code">User_List</code>, but the client disappears. This makes it impossible for the user to log on again as the server thinks the user already is logged on.</p> <p>Or what happens if the server goes down in the middle of sending a message, leaving the sending client hanging forever in the <code class="code">await_result</code> function?</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-time-outs-id71963').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-time-outs-id71963').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="time-outs">4.1 Time-outs</span></h2> <p>Before improving the messenger program, let us look at some general principles, using the ping pong program as an example. Recall that when "ping" finishes, it tells "pong" that it has done so by sending the atom <code class="code">finished</code> as a message to "pong" so that "pong" can also finish. Another way to let "pong" finish is to make "pong" exit if it does not receive a message from ping within a certain time. This can be done by adding a <strong>time-out</strong> to <code class="code">pong</code> as shown in the following example:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-module(tut19).

-export([start_ping/1, start_pong/0,  ping/2, pong/0]).

ping(0, Pong_Node) -&gt;
    io:format("ping finished~n", []);

ping(N, Pong_Node) -&gt;
    {pong, Pong_Node} ! {ping, self()},
    receive
        pong -&gt;
            io:format("Ping received pong~n", [])
    end,
    ping(N - 1, Pong_Node).

pong() -&gt;
    receive
        {ping, Ping_PID} -&gt;
            io:format("Pong received ping~n", []),
            Ping_PID ! pong,
            pong()
    after 5000 -&gt;
            io:format("Pong timed out~n", [])
    end.

start_pong() -&gt;
    register(pong, spawn(tut19, pong, [])).

start_ping(Pong_Node) -&gt;
    spawn(tut19, ping, [3, Pong_Node]).</pre> <p>After this is compiled and the file <code class="code">tut19.beam</code> is copied to the necessary directories, the following is seen on (pong@kosken): </p> <pre data-language="erlang">
(pong@kosken)1&gt; tut19:start_pong().
true
Pong received ping
Pong received ping
Pong received ping
Pong timed out</pre> <p>And the following is seen on (ping@gollum):</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
(ping@gollum)1&gt; tut19:start_ping(pong@kosken).
&lt;0.36.0&gt;
Ping received pong
Ping received pong
Ping received pong
ping finished   </pre> <p>The time-out is set in:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">pong() -&gt;
    receive
        {ping, Ping_PID} -&gt;
            io:format("Pong received ping~n", []),
            Ping_PID ! pong,
            pong()
    after 5000 -&gt;
            io:format("Pong timed out~n", [])
    end.</pre> <p>The time-out (<code class="code">after 5000</code>) is started when <code class="code">receive</code> is entered. The time-out is canceled if <code class="code">{ping,Ping_PID}</code> is received. If <code class="code">{ping,Ping_PID}</code> is not received, the actions following the time-out are done after 5000 milliseconds. <code class="code">after</code> must be last in the <code class="code">receive</code>, that is, preceded by all other message reception specifications in the <code class="code">receive</code>. It is also possible to call a function that returned an integer for the time-out:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">after pong_timeout() -&gt;</pre> <p>In general, there are better ways than using time-outs to supervise parts of a distributed Erlang system. Time-outs are usually appropriate to supervise external events, for example, if you have expected a message from some external system within a specified time. For example, a time-out can be used to log a user out of the messenger system if they have not accessed it for, say, ten minutes.</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-error-handling-id72088').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-error-handling-id72088').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="error-handling">4.2 Error Handling</span></h2> <p>Before going into details of the supervision and error handling in an Erlang system, let us see how Erlang processes terminate, or in Erlang terminology, <strong>exit</strong>.</p> <p>A process which executes <code class="code">exit(normal)</code> or simply runs out of things to do has a <strong>normal</strong> exit.</p> <p>A process which encounters a runtime error (for example, divide by zero, bad match, trying to call a function that does not exist and so on) exits with an error, that is, has an <strong>abnormal</strong> exit. A process which executes <code>exit(Reason)</code> where <code class="code">Reason</code> is any Erlang term except the atom <code class="code">normal</code>, also has an abnormal exit.</p> <p>An Erlang process can set up links to other Erlang processes. If a process calls <code>link(Other_Pid)</code> it sets up a bidirectional link between itself and the process called <code class="code">Other_Pid</code>. When a process terminates, it sends something called a <strong>signal</strong> to all the processes it has links to.</p> <p>The signal carries information about the pid it was sent from and the exit reason.</p> <p>The default behaviour of a process that receives a normal exit is to ignore the signal.</p> <p>The default behaviour in the two other cases (that is, abnormal exit) above is to:</p> <ul> <li>Bypass all messages to the receiving process.</li> <li>Kill the receiving process.</li> <li>Propagate the same error signal to the links of the killed process.</li> </ul> <p>In this way you can connect all processes in a transaction together using links. If one of the processes exits abnormally, all the processes in the transaction are killed. As it is often wanted to create a process and link to it at the same time, there is a special BIF, <code>spawn_link</code> that does the same as <code class="code">spawn</code>, but also creates a link to the spawned process.</p> <p>Now an example of the ping pong example using links to terminate "pong":</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-module(tut20).

&lt;3820.41.0&gt;
Ping received pong
Pong received ping
Ping received pong
Pong received ping
Ping received pong</pre> <p>This is a slight modification of the ping pong program where both processes are spawned from the same <code class="code">start/1</code> function, and the "ping" process can be spawned on a separate node. Notice the use of the <code class="code">link</code> BIF. "Ping" calls <code class="code">exit(ping)</code> when it finishes and this causes an exit signal to be sent to "pong", which also terminates.</p> <p>It is possible to modify the default behaviour of a process so that it does not get killed when it receives abnormal exit signals. Instead, all signals are turned into normal messages on the format <code class="code">{'EXIT',FromPID,Reason}</code> and added to the end of the receiving process' message queue. This behaviour is set by:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">process_flag(trap_exit, true)</pre> <p>There are several other process flags, see <code>erlang(3)</code>. Changing the default behaviour of a process in this way is usually not done in standard user programs, but is left to the supervisory programs in OTP. However, the ping pong program is modified to illustrate exit trapping.</p> <pre data-language="erlang">-module(tut21).

    end.</pre> <p>The following changes are added:</p> <p>The messenger server traps exits. If it receives an exit signal, <code class="code">{'EXIT',From,Reason}</code>, this means that a client process has terminated or is unreachable for one of the following reasons:</p> <ul> <li>The user has logged off (the "logoff" message is removed).</li> <li>The network connection to the client is broken.</li> <li>The node on which the client process resides has gone down.</li> <li>The client processes has done some illegal operation.</li> </ul> <p>If an exit signal is received as above, the tuple <code class="code">{From,Name}</code> is deleted from the servers <code class="code">User_List</code> using the <code class="code">server_logoff</code> function. If the node on which the server runs goes down, an exit signal (automatically generated by the system) is sent to all of the client processes: <code class="code">{'EXIT',MessengerPID,noconnection}</code> causing all the client processes to terminate.</p> <p>Also, a time-out of five seconds has been introduced in the <code class="code">await_result</code> function. That is, if the server does not reply within five seconds (5000 ms), the client terminates. This is only needed in the logon sequence before the client and the server are linked.</p> <p>An interesting case is if the client terminates before the server links to it. This is taken care of because linking to a non-existent process causes an exit signal, <code class="code">{'EXIT',From,noproc}</code>, to be automatically generated. This is as if the process terminated immediately after the link operation.</p>
