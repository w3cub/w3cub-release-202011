<h1>1 EUnit - a Lightweight Unit Testing Framework for Erlang </h1> <p>EUnit is a unit testing framework for Erlang. It is very powerful and flexible, is easy to use, and has small syntactical overhead.</p> <ul> <li><p><code><a href="#Unit_testing">Unit testing</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Getting_started">Getting started</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#EUnit_macros">EUnit macros</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#EUnit_test_representation">EUnit test representation</a></code></p></li> </ul> <p>EUnit builds on ideas from the family of unit testing frameworks for Object Oriented languages that originated with JUnit by Beck and Gamma (and Beck's previous framework SUnit for Smalltalk). However, EUnit uses techniques more adapted to functional and concurrent programming, and is typically less verbose than its relatives.</p> <p>Although EUnit uses many preprocessor macros, they have been designed to be as nonintrusive as possible, and should not cause conflicts with existing code. Adding EUnit tests to a module should thus not normally require changing existing code. Furthermore, tests that only exercise the exported functions of a module can always be placed in a completely separate module, avoiding any conflicts entirely.</p> <h2> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-unit-testing-id66398').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-unit-testing-id66398').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Unit_testing">1.1 Unit testing</span> </h2> <p>Unit Testing is testing of individual program "units" in relative isolation. There is no particular size requirement: a unit can be a function, a module, a process, or even a whole application, but the most typical testing units are individual functions or modules. In order to test a unit, you specify a set of individual tests, set up the smallest necessary environment for being able to run those tests (often, you don't need to do any setup at all), you run the tests and collect the results, and finally you do any necessary cleanup so that the test can be run again later. A Unit Testing Framework tries to help you in each stage of this process, so that it is easy to write tests, easy to run them, and easy to see which tests failed (so you can fix the bugs).</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-advantages-of-unit-testing-id62988').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-advantages-of-unit-testing-id62988').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Advantages_of_unit_testing">Advantages of unit testing</span> </h4> <dl> <dt><strong>Reduces the risks of changing the program</strong></dt> <dd><p>Most programs will be modified during their lifetime: bugs will be fixed, features will be added, optimizations may become necessary, or the code will need to be refactored or cleaned up in other ways to make it easier to work with. But every change to a working program is a risk of introducing new bugs - or reintroducing bugs that had previously been fixed. Having a set of unit tests that you can run with very little effort makes it easy to know that the code still works as it should (this use is called <strong>regression testing</strong>; see <code><a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></code>). This goes a long way to reduce the resistance to changing and refactoring code.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Helps guide and speed up the development process</strong></dt> <dd><p>By focusing on getting the code to pass the tests, the programmer can become more productive, not overspecify or get lost in premature optimizations, and create code that is correct from the very beginning (so-called <strong>test-driven development</strong>; see <code><a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></code>).</p></dd> <dt><strong>Helps separate interface from implementation</strong></dt> <dd><p>When writing tests, the programmer may discover dependencies (in order to get the tests to run) that ought not to be there, and which need to be abstracted away to get a cleaner design. This helps eliminate bad dependencies before they spread throughout the code.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Makes component integration easier</strong></dt> <dd><p>By testing in a bottom-up fashion, beginning with the smallest program units and creating a confidence in that they work as they should, it becomes easier to test that a higher-level component, consisting of several such units, also behaves according to specification (known as <strong>integration testing</strong>; see <code><a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></code>).</p></dd> <dt><strong>Is self-documenting</strong></dt> <dd><p>The tests can be read as documentation, typically showing both examples of correct and incorrect usage, along with the expected consequences.</p></dd> </dl> <h2> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-terminology-id63561').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-terminology-id63561').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Terminology">1.2 Terminology</span> </h2> <dl> <dt><strong>Unit testing</strong></dt> <dd><p>Testing that a program unit behaves as it is supposed to do (in itself), according to its specifications. Unit tests have an important function as regression tests, when the program later is modified for some reason, since they check that the program still behaves according to specification.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Regression testing</strong></dt> <dd><p>Running a set of tests after making changes to a program, to check that the program behaves as it did before the changes (except, of course, for any intentional changes in behaviour). Unit tests are important as regression tests, but regression testing can involve more than just unit testing, and may also test behaviour that might not be part of the normal specification (such as bug-for-bug-compatibility). </p></dd> <dt><strong>Integration testing</strong></dt> <dd><p>Testing that a number of individually developed program units (assumed to already have been separately unit tested) work together as expected. Depending on the system being developed, integration testing may be as simple as "just another level of unit testing", but might also involve other kinds of tests (compare <strong>system testing</strong>). </p></dd> <dt><strong>System testing</strong></dt> <dd><p>Testing that a complete system behaves according to its specification. Specifically, system testing should not require knowing any details about the implementation. It typically involves testing many different aspects of the system behaviour apart from the basic functionality, such as performance, usability, and reliability.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Test-driven development</strong></dt> <dd><p>A program development technique where you continuously write tests <strong>before</strong> you implement the code that is supposed to pass those tests. This can help you focus on solving the right problems, and not make a more complicated implementation than necessary, by letting the unit tests determine when a program is "done": if it fulfils its specifications, there is no need to keep adding functionality.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Mock object</strong></dt> <dd><p>Sometimes, testing some unit <code class="code">A</code> (e.g., a function) requires that it collaborates somehow with some other unit <code class="code">B</code> (perhaps being passed as an argument, or by reference) - but <code class="code">B</code> has not been implemented yet. A "mock object" - an object which, for the purposes of testing <code class="code">A</code>, looks and behaves like a real <code class="code">B</code> - might then be used instead. (This is of course only useful if it would be significantly more work to implement a real <code class="code">B</code> than to create a mock object.)</p></dd> <dt><strong>Test case</strong></dt> <dd><p>A single, well-defined test, that somehow can be uniquely identified. When executed, the test case either <strong>passes</strong> or <strong>fails</strong>; the test report should identify exactly which test cases failed.</p></dd> <dt><strong>Test suite</strong></dt> <dd><p>A collection of test cases, generally with a specific, common target for testing, such as a single function, module, or subsystem. A test suite may also be recursively composed by smaller test suites.</p></dd> </dl> <h2> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-getting-started-id63084').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-getting-started-id63084').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Getting_started">1.3 Getting started</span> </h2> <ul> <li><p><code><a href="#Including_the_EUnit_header_file">Including the EUnit header file</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Writing_simple_test_functions">Writing simple test functions</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Running_EUnit">Running EUnit</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Writing_test_generating_functions">Writing test generating functions</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#An_example">An example</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Disabling_testing">Disabling testing</a></code></p></li> <li><p><code><a href="#Avoiding_compile-time_dependency_on_EUnit">Avoiding compile-time dependency on EUnit</a></code></p></li> </ul> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-including-the-eunit-header-file-id59373').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-including-the-eunit-header-file-id59373').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Including_the_EUnit_header_file">Including the EUnit header file</span> </h4> <p> The simplest way to use EUnit in an Erlang module is to add the following line at the beginning of the module (after the <code class="code">-module</code> declaration, but before any function definitions): </p> <pre data-language="erlang">-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").</pre> <p> This will have the following effect: </p> <ul> <li><p>Creates an exported function <code class="code">test()</code> (unless testing is turned off, and the module does not already contain a test() function), that can be used to run all the unit tests defined in the module</p></li> <li><p>Causes all functions whose names match <code class="code">..._test()</code> or <code class="code">..._test_()</code> to be automatically exported from the module (unless testing is turned off, or the <code class="code">EUNIT_NOAUTO</code> macro is defined)</p></li> <li><p>Makes all the preprocessor macros of EUnit available, to help writing tests</p></li> </ul> <p> <strong>Note:</strong> For <code class="code">-include_lib(...)</code> to work, the Erlang module search path <strong>must</strong> contain a directory whose name ends in <code class="code">eunit/ebin</code> (pointing to the <code class="code">ebin</code> subdirectory of the EUnit installation directory). If EUnit is installed as <code class="code">lib/eunit</code> under your Erlang/OTP system directory, its <code class="code">ebin</code> subdirectory will be automatically added to the search path when Erlang starts. Otherwise, you need to add the directory explicitly, by passing a <code class="code">-pa</code> flag to the <code class="code">erl</code> or <code class="code">erlc</code> command. For example, a Makefile could contain the following action for compiling <code class="code">.erl</code> files: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">erlc -pa "path/to/eunit/ebin" $(ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS) -o$(EBIN) $&lt;</pre> <p> or if you want Eunit to always be available when you run Erlang interactively, you can add a line like the following to your <code class="code">$HOME/.erlang</code> file: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">code:add_path("/path/to/eunit/ebin").</pre> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-writing-simple-test-functions-id63167').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-writing-simple-test-functions-id63167').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Writing_simple_test_functions">Writing simple test functions</span> </h4> <p>The EUnit framework makes it extremely easy to write unit tests in Erlang. There are a few different ways of writing them, though, so we start with the simplest:</p> <p>A function with a name ending in <code class="code">..._test()</code> is recognized by EUnit as a simple test function - it takes no arguments, and its execution either succeeds (returning some arbitrary value that EUnit will throw away), or fails by throwing an exception of some kind (or by not terminating, in which case it will be aborted after a while).</p> <p>An example of a simple test function could be the following: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">reverse_test() -&gt; lists:reverse([1,2,3]).</pre> <p> This just tests that the function <code class="code">lists:reverse(List)</code> does not crash when <code class="code">List</code> is <code class="code">[1,2,3]</code>. It is not a great test, but many people write simple functions like this one to test the basic functionality of their code, and those tests can be used directly by EUnit, without changes, as long as their function names match.</p> <p><strong id="Use_exceptions_to_signal_failure">Use exceptions to signal failure</strong> To write more interesting tests, we need to make them crash (throw an exception) when they don't get the result they expect. A simple way of doing this is to use pattern matching with <code class="code">=</code>, as in the following examples: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">reverse_nil_test() -&gt; [] = lists:reverse([]).
reverse_one_test() -&gt; [1] = lists:reverse([1]).
reverse_two_test() -&gt; [2,1] = lists:reverse([1,2]).</pre> <p> If there was some bug in <code class="code">lists:reverse/1</code> that made it return something other than <code class="code">[2,1]</code> when it got <code class="code">[1,2]</code> as input, then the last test above would throw a <code class="code">badmatch</code> error. The first two (we assume they do not get a <code class="code">badmatch</code>) would simply return <code class="code">[]</code> and <code class="code">[1]</code>, respectively, so both succeed. (Note that EUnit is not psychic: if you write a test that returns a value, even if it is the wrong value, EUnit will consider it a success. You must make sure that the test is written so that it causes a crash if the result is not what it should be.)</p> <p><strong id="Using_assert_macros">Using assert macros</strong> If you want to use Boolean operators for your tests, the <code class="code">assert</code> macro comes in handy (see <code><a href="#EUnit_macros">EUnit macros</a></code> for details): </p> <pre data-language="erlang">length_test() -&gt; ?assert(length([1,2,3]) =:= 3).</pre> <p> The <code class="code">?assert(Expression)</code> macro will evaluate <code class="code">Expression</code>, and if that does not evaluate to <code class="code">true</code>, it will throw an exception; otherwise it just returns <code class="code">ok</code>. In the above example, the test will thus fail if the call to <code class="code">length</code> does not return 3.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-running-eunit-id63725').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-running-eunit-id63725').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Running_EUnit">Running EUnit</span> </h4> <p>If you have added the declaration <code class="code">-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl")</code> to your module, as described above, you only need to compile the module, and run the automatically exported function <code class="code">test()</code>. For example, if your module was named <code class="code">m</code>, then calling <code class="code">m:test()</code> will run EUnit on all the tests defined in the module. You do not need to write <code class="code">-export</code> declarations for the test functions. This is all done by magic.</p> <p>You can also use the function <code><a href="eunit#test-1">eunit:test/1</a></code> to run arbitrary tests, for example to try out some more advanced test descriptors (see <code><a href="#EUnit_test_representation">EUnit test representation</a></code>). For example, running <code class="code">eunit:test(m)</code> does the same thing as the auto-generated function <code class="code">m:test()</code>, while <code class="code">eunit:test({inparallel, m})</code> runs the same test cases but executes them all in parallel.</p> <p><strong id="Putting_tests_in_separate_modules">Putting tests in separate modules</strong> </p> <p>If you want to separate your test code from your normal code (at least for testing the exported functions), you can simply write the test functions in a module named <code class="code">m_tests</code> (note: not <code class="code">m_test</code>), if your module is named <code class="code">m</code>. Then, whenever you ask EUnit to test the module <code class="code">m</code>, it will also look for the module <code class="code">m_tests</code> and run those tests as well. See <code class="code">ModuleName</code> in the section <code><a href="#Primitives">Primitives</a></code> for details.</p> <p><strong id="EUnit_captures_standard_output">EUnit captures standard output</strong> </p> <p>If your test code writes to the standard output, you may be surprised to see that the text does not appear on the console when the tests are running. This is because EUnit captures all standard output from test functions (this also includes setup and cleanup functions, but not generator functions), so that it can be included in the test report if errors occur. To bypass EUnit and print text directly to the console while testing, you can write to the <code class="code">user</code> output stream, as in <code class="code">io:format(user, "~w", [Term])</code>. The recommended way of doing this is to use the EUnit <code><a href="#Debugging_macros">Debugging macros</a></code>, which make it much simpler.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-writing-test-generating-functions-id63863').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-writing-test-generating-functions-id63863').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Writing_test_generating_functions">Writing test generating functions</span> </h4> <p>A drawback of simple test functions is that you must write a separate function (with a separate name) for each test case. A more compact way of writing tests (and much more flexible, as we shall see), is to write functions that <strong>return</strong> tests, instead of <strong>being</strong> tests.</p> <p>A function with a name ending in <code class="code">..._test_()</code> (note the final underscore) is recognized by EUnit as a <strong>test generator</strong> function. Test generators return a <strong>representation</strong> of a <strong>set of tests</strong> to be executed by EUnit.</p> <p><strong id="Representing_a_test_as_data">Representing a test as data</strong> The most basic representation of a test is a single fun-expression that takes no arguments. For example, the following test generator: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">basic_test_() -&gt;
    fun () -&gt; ?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2) end.</pre> <p> will have the same effect as the following simple test: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">simple_test() -&gt;
    ?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2).</pre> <p> (in fact, EUnit will handle all simple tests just like it handles fun-expressions: it will put them in a list, and run them one by one).</p> <p><strong id="Using_macros_to_write_tests">Using macros to write tests</strong> To make tests more compact and readable, as well as automatically add information about the line number in the source code where a test occurred (and reduce the number of characters you have to type), you can use the <code class="code">_test</code> macro (note the initial underscore character), like this: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">basic_test_() -&gt;
    ?_test(?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2)).</pre> <p> The <code class="code">_test</code> macro takes any expression (the "body") as argument, and places it within a fun-expression (along with some extra information). The body can be any kind of test expression, just like the body of a simple test function.</p> <p><strong id="Underscore-prefixed_macros_create_test_objects">Underscore-prefixed macros create test objects</strong> But this example can be made even shorter! Most test macros, such as the family of <code class="code">assert</code> macros, have a corresponding form with an initial underscore character, which automatically adds a <code class="code">?_test(...)</code> wrapper. The above example can then simply be written: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">basic_test_() -&gt;
    ?_assert(1 + 1 =:= 2).</pre> <p> which has exactly the same meaning (note the <code class="code">_assert</code> instead of <code class="code">assert</code>). You can think of the initial underscore as signalling <strong>test object</strong>.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-an-example-id66272').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-an-example-id66272').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="An_example">An example</span> </h4> <p> Sometimes, an example says more than a thousand words. The following small Erlang module shows how EUnit can be used in practice. </p> <pre data-language="erlang">   -module(fib).
   -export([fib/1]).
   -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

   fib(1) -&gt; 1;
   fib(N) when N &gt; 1 -&gt; fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).

?_assert(fib(4) =:= 5),
?_assert(fib(5) =:= 8),
?_assertException(error, function_clause, fib(-1)),
?_assert(fib(31) =:= 2178309)
       ].</pre> <p>(Author's note: When I first wrote this example, I happened to write a <code class="code">*</code> instead of <code class="code">+</code> in the <code class="code">fib</code> function. Of course, this showed up immediately when I ran the tests.)</p> <p>See <code><a href="#EUnit_test_representation">EUnit test representation</a></code> for a full list of all the ways you can specify test sets in EUnit.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-disabling-testing-id66318').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-disabling-testing-id66318').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Disabling_testing">Disabling testing</span> </h4> <p> Testing can be turned off by defining the <code class="code">NOTEST</code> macro when compiling, for example as an option to <code class="code">erlc</code>, as in: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">erlc -DNOTEST my_module.erl</pre> <p> or by adding a macro definition to the code, <strong>before the EUnit header file is included</strong>: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">-define(NOTEST, 1).</pre> <p> (the value is not important, but should typically be 1 or <code class="code">true</code>). Note that unless the <code class="code">EUNIT_NOAUTO</code> macro is defined, disabling testing will also automatically strip all test functions from the code, except for any that are explicitly declared as exported.</p> <p>For instance, to use EUnit in your application, but with testing turned off by default, put the following lines in a header file: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">-define(NOTEST, true).
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").</pre> <p> and then make sure that every module of your application includes that header file. This means that you have a only a single place to modify in order to change the default setting for testing. To override the <code class="code">NOTEST</code> setting without modifying the code, you can define <code class="code">TEST</code> in a compiler option, like this: </p> <pre data-language="erlang">erlc -DTEST my_module.erl</pre> <p>See <code><a href="#Compilation_control_macros">Compilation control macros</a></code> for details about these macros.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-avoiding-compile-time-dependency-on-eunit-id62648').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-avoiding-compile-time-dependency-on-eunit-id62648').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Avoiding_compile-time_dependency_on_EUnit">Avoiding compile-time dependency on EUnit</span> </h4> <p> If you are distributing the source code for your application for other people to compile and run, you probably want to ensure that the code compiles even if EUnit is not available.

The arguments are described in detail below. </p></dd> <dt><strong><code class="code">{node, Node::atom(), Tests | Instantiator}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{node, Node::atom(), Args::string(), Tests | Instantiator}</code></strong></dt> <dd><p><code class="code">node</code> is like <code class="code">setup</code>, but with a built-in behaviour: it starts a slave node for the duration of the tests. The atom <code class="code">Node</code> should have the format <code class="code">nodename@full.machine.name</code>, and <code class="code">Args</code> are the optional arguments to the new node; see <code class="code">slave:start_link/3</code> for details. </p></dd> <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreach, Where, Setup, Cleanup, [Tests | Instantiator]}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreach, Setup, Cleanup, [Tests | Instantiator]}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreach, Where, Setup, [Tests | Instantiator]}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreach, Setup, [Tests | Instantiator]}</code></strong></dt> <dd><p><code class="code">foreach</code> is used to set up a fixture and optionally tear it down afterwards, repeated for each single one of the specified test sets. </p></dd> <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreachx, Where, SetupX, CleanupX, Pairs::[{X::any(), ((X::any(), R::any()) -&gt; Tests)}]}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreachx, SetupX, CleanupX, Pairs}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreachx, Where, SetupX, Pairs}</code></strong></dt>  <dt><strong><code class="code">{foreachx, SetupX, Pairs}</code></strong></dt> <dd><p><code class="code">foreachx</code> is like <code class="code">foreach</code>, but uses a list of pairs, each containing an extra argument <code class="code">X</code> and an extended instantiator function. </p></dd> </dl> <p>A <code class="code">Setup</code> function is executed just before any of the specified tests are run, and a <code class="code">Cleanup</code> function is executed when no more of the specified tests will be run, regardless of the reason. A <code class="code">Setup</code> function takes no argument, and returns some value which will be passed as it is to the <code class="code">Cleanup</code> function. A <code class="code">Cleanup</code> function should do whatever necessary and return some arbitrary value, such as the atom <code class="code">ok</code>. (<code class="code">SetupX</code> and <code class="code">CleanupX</code> functions are similar, but receive one additional argument: some value <code class="code">X</code>, which depends on the context.) When no <code class="code">Cleanup</code> function is specified, a dummy function is used which has no effect.</p> <p>An <code class="code">Instantiator</code> function receives the same value as the <code class="code">Cleanup</code> function, i.e., the value returned by the <code class="code">Setup</code> function. It should then behave much like a generator (see <code><a href="#Primitives">Primitives</a></code>), and return a test set whose tests have been <strong>instantiated</strong> with the given value. A special case is the syntax <code class="code">{with, [AbstractTestFun]}</code> which represents an instantiator function that distributes the value over a list of unary functions; see <code><a href="#Primitives">Primitives</a></code>: <code class="code">{with, X, [...]}</code> for more details.</p> <p>A <code class="code">Where</code> term controls how the specified tests are executed. The default is <code class="code">spawn</code>, which means that the current process handles the setup and teardown, while the tests are executed in a subprocess. <code class="code">{spawn, Node}</code> is like <code class="code">spawn</code>, but runs the subprocess on the specified node. <code class="code">local</code> means that the current process will handle both setup/teardown and running the tests - the drawback is that if a test times out so that the process is killed, the <strong>cleanup will not be performed</strong>; hence, avoid this for persistent fixtures such as file operations. In general, <code class="code">local</code> should only be used when: </p> <ul> <li><p>the setup/teardown needs to be executed by the process that will run the tests;</p></li> <li><p>no further teardown needs to be done if the process is killed (i.e., no state outside the process was affected by the setup)</p></li> </ul> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-lazy-generators-id64844').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-lazy-generators-id64844').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="Lazy_generators">Lazy generators</span> </h4> <p>Sometimes, it can be convenient not to produce the whole set of test descriptions before the testing begins; for example, if you want to generate a huge amount of tests that would take up too much space to keep in memory all at once.</p> <p>It is fairly easy to write a generator which, each time it is called, either produces an empty list if it is done, or otherwise produces a list containing a single test case plus a new generator which will produce the rest of the tests. This demonstrates the basic pattern:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">lazy_test_() -&gt;
    lazy_gen(10000).

lazy_gen(N) -&gt;
    {generator,
     fun () -&gt;
         if N &gt; 0 -&gt;
                [?_test(...)
                 | lazy_gen(N-1)];
            true -&gt;
                []
         end
     end}.</pre> <p>When EUnit traverses the test representation in order to run the tests, the new generator will not be called to produce the next test until the previous test has been executed.</p> <p>Note that it is easiest to write this kind of recursive generator using a help function, like the <code class="code">lazy_gen/1</code> function above. It can also be written using a recursive fun, if you prefer to not clutter your function namespace and are comfortable with writing that kind of code. </p>
