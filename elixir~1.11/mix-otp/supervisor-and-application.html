<div class="getting-started-title"> <small>Mix and OTP</small> <h1>Supervisor and Application</h1> </div>  <blockquote> <p>This chapter is part of the <i>Mix and OTP guide</i> and it depends on previous chapters in this guide. For more information, <a href="introduction-to-mix">read the introduction guide</a> or check out the chapter index in the sidebar.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the previous chapter about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GenServer</code>, we implemented <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> to manage buckets. At some point, we started monitoring buckets so we were able to take action whenever a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Bucket</code> crashed. Although the change was relatively small, it introduced a question which is frequently asked by Elixir developers: what happens when something fails?</p> <p>Before we added monitoring, if a bucket crashed, the registry would forever point to a bucket that no longer exists. If a user tried to read or write to the crashed bucket, it would fail. Any attempt at creating a new bucket with the same name would just return the PID of the crashed bucket. In other words, that registry entry for that bucket would forever be in a bad state. Once we added monitoring, the registry automatically removes the entry for the crashed bucket. Trying to lookup the crashed bucket now (correctly) says the bucket does not exist and a user of the system can successfully create a new one if desired.</p> <p>In practice, we are not expecting the processes working as buckets to fail. But, if it does happen, for whatever reason, we can rest assured that our system will continue to work as intended.</p> <p>If you have prior programming experience, you may be wondering: “could we just guarantee the bucket does not crash in the first place?”. As we will see, Elixir developers tend to refer to those practices as “defensive programming”. That’s because a live production system has dozens of different reasons why something can go wrong. The disk can fail, memory can be corrupted, bugs, the network may stop working for a second, etc. If we were to write software that attempted to protect or circumvent all of those errors, we would spend more time handling failures than writing our own software!</p> <p>Therefore, an Elixir developer prefers to “let it crash” or “fail fast”. And one of the most common ways we can recover from a failure is by restarting whatever part of the system crashed.</p> <p>For example, imagine your computer, router, printer, or whatever device is not working properly. How often do you fix it by restarting it? Once we restart the device, we reset the device back to its initial state, which is well-tested and guaranteed to work. In Elixir, we apply this same approach to software: whenever a process crashes, we start a new process to perform the same job as the crashed process.</p> <p>In Elixir, this is done by a Supervisor. A Supervisor is a process that supervises other processes and restarts them whenever they crash. To do so, Supervisors manage the whole life-cycle of any supervised processes, including startup and shutdown.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will learn how to put those concepts into practice by supervising the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> process. After all, if something goes wrong with the registry, the whole registry is lost and no bucket could ever be found! To address this, we will define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Supervisor</code> module that guarantees that our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> is up and running at any given moment.</p> <p>At the end of the chapter, we will also talk about Applications. As we will see, Mix has been packaging all of our code into an application, and we will learn how to customize our application to guarantee that our Supervisor and the Registry are up and running whenever our system starts.</p> <h2 id="our-first-supervisor">Our first supervisor</h2> <p>A supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we refer to as child processes. The act of supervising a process includes three distinct responsibilities. The first one is to start child processes. Once a child process is running, the supervisor may restart a child process, either because it terminated abnormally or because a certain condition was reached. For example, a supervisor may restart all children if any child dies. Finally, a supervisor is also responsible for shutting down the child processes when the system is shutting down. Please see the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> module for a more in-depth discussion.</p> <p>Creating a supervisor is not much different from creating a GenServer. We are going to define a module named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Supervisor</code>, which will use the Supervisor behaviour, inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/kv/supervisor.ex</code> file:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KV.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor

  def start_link(opts) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(:ok) do
    children = [
      KV.Registry
    ]

    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>Our supervisor has a single child so far: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code>. After we define a list of children, we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Supervisor.init/2</code>, passing the children and the supervision strategy.</p> <p>The supervision strategy dictates what happens when one of the children crashes. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:one_for_one</code> means that if a child dies, it will be the only one restarted. Since we have only one child now, that’s all we need. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Supervisor</code> behaviour supports many different strategies and we will discuss them in this chapter.</p> <p>Once the supervisor starts, it will traverse the list of children and it will invoke the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">child_spec/1</code> function on each module.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">child_spec/1</code> function returns the child specification which describes how to start the process, if the process is a worker or a supervisor, if the process is temporary, transient or permanent and so on. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">child_spec/1</code> function is automatically defined when we <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use Agent</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use GenServer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use Supervisor</code>, etc. Let’s give it a try in the terminal with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex(1)&gt; KV.Registry.child_spec([])
%{id: KV.Registry, start: {KV.Registry, :start_link, [[]]}}
</pre></div> <p>We will learn those details as we move forward on this guide. If you would rather peek ahead, check the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> docs.</p> <p>After the supervisor retrieves all child specifications, it proceeds to start its children one by one, in the order they were defined, using the information in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:start</code> key in the child specification. For our current specification, it will call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.start_link([])</code>.</p> <p>Let’s take the supervisor for a spin:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex(1)&gt; {:ok, sup} = KV.Supervisor.start_link([])
{:ok, #PID&lt;0.148.0&gt;}
iex(2)&gt; Supervisor.which_children(sup)
[{KV.Registry, #PID&lt;0.150.0&gt;, :worker, [KV.Registry]}]
</pre></div> <p>So far we have started the supervisor and listed its children. Once the supervisor started, it also started all of its children.</p> <p>What happens if we intentionally crash the registry started by the supervisor? Let’s do so by sending it a bad input on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex(3)&gt; [{_, registry, _, _}] = Supervisor.which_children(sup)
[{KV.Registry, #PID&lt;0.150.0&gt;, :worker, [KV.Registry]}]
iex(4) GenServer.call(registry, :bad_input)
08:52:57.311 [error] GenServer KV.Registry terminating
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in KV.Registry.handle_call/3
iex(5) Supervisor.which_children(sup)
[{KV.Registry, #PID&lt;0.157.0&gt;, :worker, [KV.Registry]}]
</pre></div> <p>Notice how the supervisor automatically started a new registry, with a new PID, in place of the first one once we caused it to crash due to a bad input.</p> <p>In the previous chapters, we have always started processes directly. For example, we would call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.start_link([])</code>, which would return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:ok, pid}</code>, and that would allow us to interact with the registry via its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pid</code>. Now that processes are started by the supervisor, we have to directly ask the supervisor who its children are, and fetch the pid from the returned list of children. In practice, doing so every time would be very expensive. To address this, we often give names to processes, allowing them to be uniquely identified in a single machine from anywhere in our code.</p> <p>Let’s learn how to do that.</p> <h2 id="naming-processes">Naming processes</h2> <p>While our application will have many buckets, it will only have a single registry. Therefore, whenever we start the registry, we want to give it a unique name so we can reach out to it from anywhere. We do so by passing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:name</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.start_link/1</code>.</p> <p>Let’s slightly change our children definition (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Supervisor.init/1</code>) to be a list of tuples instead of a list of atoms:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">  def init(:ok) do
    children = [
      {KV.Registry, name: KV.Registry}
    ]
</pre></div> <p>With this in place, the supervisor will now start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.start_link(name: KV.Registry)</code>.</p> <p>If you revisit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry.start_link/1</code> implementation, you will remember it simply passes the options to GenServer:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end
</pre></div> <p>which in turn will register the process with the given name. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:name</code> option expects an atom for locally named processes (locally named means it is available to this machine - there are other options, which we won’t discuss here). Since module identifiers are atoms (try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i(KV.Registry)</code> in IEx), we can name a process after the module that implements it, provided there is only one process for that name. This helps when debugging and introspecting the system.</p> <p>Let’s give the updated supervisor a try inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; KV.Supervisor.start_link([])
{:ok, #PID&lt;0.66.0&gt;}
iex&gt; KV.Registry.create(KV.Registry, "shopping")
:ok
iex&gt; KV.Registry.lookup(KV.Registry, "shopping")
{:ok, #PID&lt;0.70.0&gt;}
</pre></div> <p>This time the supervisor started a named registry, allowing us to create buckets without having to explicitly fetch the PID from the supervisor. You should also know how to make the registry crash again, without looking up its PID: give it a try.</p> <blockquote> <p>At this point, you may be wondering: should you also locally name bucket processes? Remember buckets are started dynamically based on user input. Since local names MUST be atoms, we would have to dynamically create atoms, which is a bad idea since once an atom is defined, it is never erased nor garbage collected. This means that, if we create atoms dynamically based on user input, we will eventually run out of memory (or to be more precise, the VM will crash because it imposes a hard limit on the number of atoms). This limitation is precisely why we created our own registry (or why one would use Elixir’s built-in <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Registry</code></a> module).</p> </blockquote> <p>We are getting closer and closer to a fully working system. The supervisor automatically starts the registry. But how can we automatically start the supervisor whenever our system starts? To answer this question, let’s talk about applications.</p> <h2 id="understanding-applications">Understanding applications</h2> <p>We have been working inside an application this entire time. Every time we changed a file and ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix compile</code>, we could see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Generated kv app</code> message in the compilation output.</p> <p>We can find the generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_build/dev/lib/kv/ebin/kv.app</code>. Let’s have a look at its contents:</p> <div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">{application,kv,
             [{applications,[kernel,stdlib,elixir,logger]},
              {description,"kv"},
              {modules,['Elixir.KV','Elixir.KV.Bucket','Elixir.KV.Registry',
                        'Elixir.KV.Supervisor']},
              {registered,[]},
              {vsn,"0.1.0"}]}.
</pre></div> <p>This file contains Erlang terms (written using Erlang syntax). Even though we are not familiar with Erlang, it is easy to guess this file holds our application definition. It contains our application <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">version</code>, all the modules defined by it, as well as a list of applications we depend on, like Erlang’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kernel</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elixir</code> itself, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logger</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logger</code> application ships as part of Elixir. We stated that our application needs it by specifying it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:extra_applications</code> list in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code>. See the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/logger">official docs</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote> <p>In a nutshell, an application consists of all of the modules defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file, including the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file itself. An application has generally only two directories: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ebin</code>, for Elixir artefacts, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.beam</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> files, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priv</code>, with any other artefact or asset you may need in your application.</p> <p>Although Mix generates and maintains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file for us, we can customize its contents by adding new entries to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/0</code> function inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> project file. We are going to do our first customization soon.</p> <h3 id="starting-applications">Starting applications</h3> <p>Each application in our system can be started and stopped. The rules for starting and stopping an application are also defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file. When we invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>, Mix compiles our application and then starts it.</p> <p>Let’s see this in practice. Start a console with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code> and try:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; Application.start(:kv)
{:error, {:already_started, :kv}}
</pre></div> <p>Oops, it’s already started. Mix starts the current application and all of its dependencies automatically. This is also true for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix test</code> and many other Mix commands.</p> <p>You can change this behaviour by giving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--no-start</code> flag to Mix. It is rarely used in practice but it allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms better. Let’s give it a try.</p> <p>Invoking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix</code> is the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix run</code>. Therefore, if you want to pass a flag to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>, we just need to add the task name and the desired flags. For example, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix run --no-start</code>:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; Application.start(:kv)
:ok
</pre></div> <p>We can stop our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:logger</code> application, which is started by default with Elixir:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; Application.stop(:kv)
:ok
iex&gt; Application.stop(:logger)
:ok
</pre></div> <p>And let’s try to start our application again:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; Application.start(:kv)
{:error, {:not_started, :logger}}
</pre></div> <p>Now we get an error because an application that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> depends on (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:logger</code> in this case) isn’t started. We need to either start each application manually in the correct order or call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application.ensure_all_started</code> as follows:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex&gt; Application.ensure_all_started(:kv)
{:ok, [:logger, :kv]}
</pre></div> <p>In practice, our tools always start our applications for us, but there is an API available if you need fine-grained control.</p> <h2 id="the-application-callback">The application callback</h2> <p>Whenever we invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>, Mix automatically starts our application by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application.start(:kv)</code>. But can we customize what happens when our application starts? As a matter of fact, we can! To do so, we define an application callback.</p> <p>The first step is to tell our application definition (i.e. our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> file) which module is going to implement the application callback. Let’s do so by opening <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> and changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def application</code> to the following:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger],
      mod: {KV, []}
    ]
  end
</pre></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:mod</code> option specifies the “application callback module”, followed by the arguments to be passed on application start. The application callback module can be any module that implements the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html">Application</a> behaviour.</p> <p>To implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application</code> behaviour, we have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use Application</code> and define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start/2</code> function. The goal of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start/2</code> is to start a supervisor, which will then start any child services or execute any other code our application may need. Let’s use this opportunity to start the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Supervisor</code> we have implemented earlier in this chapter.</p> <p>Since we have specified <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV</code> as the module callback, let’s change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV</code> module defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/kv.ex</code> to implement a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start/2</code> function:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">defmodule KV do
  use Application

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    # Although we don't use the supervisor name below directly,
    # it can be useful when debugging or introspecting the system.
    KV.Supervisor.start_link(name: KV.Supervisor)
  end
end
</pre></div> <blockquote> <p>Please note that by doing this, we are breaking the boilerplate test case which tested the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV</code>. You can simply remove that test case.</p> </blockquote> <p>When we <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use Application</code>, we may define a couple of functions, similar to when we used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Supervisor</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GenServer</code>. This time we only had to define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start/2</code> function. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application</code> behaviour also has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop/1</code> callback, but it is rarely used in practice. You can check the documentation for more information.</p> <p>Now that you have defined an application callback which starts our supervisor, we expect the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code> process to be up and running as soon we start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>. Let’s give it another try:</p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">iex(1)&gt; KV.Registry.create(KV.Registry, "shopping")
:ok
iex(2)&gt; KV.Registry.lookup(KV.Registry, "shopping")
{:ok, #PID&lt;0.88.0&gt;}
</pre></div> <p>Let’s recap what is happening. Whenever we invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iex -S mix</code>, it automatically starts our application by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application.start(:kv)</code>, which then invokes the application callback. The application callback’s job is to start a <strong>supervision tree</strong>. Right now, we only have a single supervisor, but sometimes a supervisor is also supervised, giving it a shape of a tree. So far, our supervisor has a single child, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code>, which is started with name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KV.Registry</code>.</p> <h2 id="projects-or-applications">Projects or applications?</h2> <p>Mix makes a distinction between projects and applications. Based on the contents of our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.exs</code> file, we would say we have a Mix project that defines the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:kv</code> application. As we will see in later chapters, there are projects that don’t define any application.</p> <p>When we say “project” you should think about Mix. Mix is the tool that manages your project. It knows how to compile your project, test your project and more. It also knows how to compile and start the application relevant to your project.</p> <p>When we talk about applications, we talk about <abbr title="Open Telecom Platform">OTP</abbr>. Applications are the entities that are started and stopped as a whole by the runtime. You can learn more about applications and how they relate to booting and shutting down of your system as a whole in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html">docs for the Application module</a>.</p> <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2> <p>Although this chapter was the first time we implemented a supervisor, it was not the first time we used one! In the previous chapter, when we used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_supervised!</code> to start the registry during our tests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ExUnit</code> started the registry under a supervisor managed by the ExUnit framework itself. By defining our own supervisor, we provide more structure on how we initialize, shutdown and supervise processes in our applications, aligning our production code and tests with best practices.</p> <p>But we are not done yet. So far we are supervising the registry but our application is also starting buckets. Since buckets are started dynamically, they have to be supervised by a special type of supervisor, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DynamicSupervisor</code>, which we will explore next.</p>
