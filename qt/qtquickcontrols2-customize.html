<h1 class="title">Customizing Qt Quick Controls</h1>   <p>Qt Quick Controls consist of a hierarchy (tree) of items. In order to provide a custom look and feel, the default QML implementation of each item can be replaced with a custom one.</p> <h2 id="customizing-a-control">Customizing a Control
</h2> <p>Sometimes you'll want to create a "one-off" look for a specific part of your UI, and use a complete style everywhere else. Perhaps you're happy with the style you're using, but there's a certain button that has some special significance.</p> <p>The first way to create this button is to simply define it in-place, wherever it is needed. For example, perhaps you're not satisfied with the Basic style's Button having square corners. To make them rounded, you can override the <a href="qml-qtquick-controls2-control#background-prop">background</a> item and set the radius property of Rectangle:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {
    width: 400
    height: 400
    visible: true

    Button {
        id: button
        text: "A Special Button"
        background: Rectangle {
            implicitWidth: 100
            implicitHeight: 40
            color: button.down ? "#d6d6d6" : "#f6f6f6"
            border.color: "#26282a"
            border.width: 1
            radius: 4
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>The second way to create the button is good if you plan to use your rounded button in several places. It involves moving the code into its own QML file within your project.</p> <p>For this approach, we'll copy the background code from the Basic style's <code>Button.qml</code>. This file can be found in the following path in your Qt installation:</p> <p><code>$QTDIR/qml/QtQuick/Controls/Basic/Button.qml</code></p> <p>After doing that, we'll simply add the following line:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">radius: 4</pre> <p>To avoid confusion with the controls in the module itself, we'll call the file <code>MyButton.qml</code>. To use the control in your application, refer to it by its filename:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {
    MyButton {
        text: qsTr("A Special Button")
    }
}</pre> <p>The third way to create the button is a bit more structured, both in terms of where the file sits in the file system and how it is used in QML. First, copy an existing file as you did above, but this time, put it into a subfolder in your project named (for example) <code>controls</code>. To use the control, first import the folder into a namespace:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick.Controls
import "controls" as MyControls

ApplicationWindow {
    MyControls.Button {
        text: qsTr("A Special Button")
    }
}</pre> <p>As you now have the <code>MyControls</code> namespace, you can name the controls after their actual counterparts in the Qt Quick Controls module. You can repeat this process for any control that you wish to add.</p> <p>An added benefit of these three methods is that it's not necessary to implement the template from scratch.</p> <h2 id="creating-a-custom-style">Creating a Custom Style
</h2> <p>There are several ways to go about creating your own styles. Below, we'll explain the various approaches.</p> <h3 id="definition-of-a-style">Definition of a Style
</h3> <p>In Qt Quick Controls, a style is essentially a set of QML files within a single directory. There are four requirements for a style to be <a href="qtquickcontrols2-styles#using-styles-in-qt-quick-controls">usable</a>:</p> <ul> <li>At least one QML file whose name matches a control (for example, <code>Button.qml</code>) must exist.</li> <li>Each QML file must contain the relevant type from the <a href="qtquicktemplates2-index">QtQuick.Templates</a> import as the root item. For example, Button.qml must contain a Button template as its root item.<p>If we instead used the corresponding type from the <a href="qtquickcontrols-index">QtQuick.Controls</a> import as we did in the previous section, it would not work: the control we were defining would try to derive from itself.</p> </li> <li>A <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtqml-modules-qmldir.html">qmldir</a> file must exist alongside the QML file(s). Below is an example of a simple <code>qmldir</code> file for a style that provides a button:<pre data-language="cpp">module MyStyle
Button 2.15 Button.qml</pre> <p>If you're using <a href="qtquickcontrols2-styles#compile-time-style-selection">compile-time style selection</a>, the qmldir should also import the fallback style:</p> <pre data-language="cpp"># ...
import QtQuick.Controls.Basic auto</pre> <p>This can also be done for <a href="qtquickcontrols2-styles#run-time-style-selection">run-time style selection</a> instead of using, for example, <a href="qquickstyle#setFallbackStyle">QQuickStyle::setFallbackStyle</a>().</p> <p>The directory structure for such a style looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">MyStyle
├─── Button.qml
└─── qmldir</pre> </li> <li>The files must be in a directory that is findable via the <a href="qtqml-syntax-imports#qml-import-path">QML Import Path</a>.<p>For example, if the path to <i>MyStyle</i> directory mentioned above was <code>/home/user/MyApp/MyStyle</code>, then <code>/home/user/MyApp</code> must be added to the QML import path.</p> <p>To <a href="qtquickcontrols2-styles#using-styles-in-qt-quick-controls">use</a> <i>MyStyle</i> in <i>MyApp</i>, refer to it by name:</p> <ul> <li><code>./MyApp -style MyStyle</code></li> </ul> <p>The style name must match the casing of the style directory; passing <i>mystyle</i> or <i>MYSTYLE</i> is not supported.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By default, the styling system uses the Basic style as a fallback for controls that aren't implemented. To customize or extend any other built-in style, it is possible to specify a different fallback style using <a href="qquickstyle">QQuickStyle</a>.</p> <p>What this means is that you can implement as many controls as you like for your custom style, and place them almost anywhere. It also allows users to create their own styles for your application.</p> <h4 id="previewing-custom-styles-in-qt-quick-designer">Previewing Custom Styles in Qt Quick Designer
</h4> <p>Using the approach above, it is possible to preview a custom style in Qt Quick Designer. In order to do so, ensure that the project has a <a href="qtquickcontrols2-configuration">qtquickcontrols2.conf</a> file, and that the following entry exists:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">[Controls]
Style=MyStyle</pre> <p>For more information, take a look at the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquickcontrols-flatstyle-example.html">Flat Style example</a>.</p> <h3 id="style-specific-c-extensions">Style-specific C++ Extensions
</h3> <p>Sometimes you may need to use C++ to extend your custom style. There are two ways to expose such types to QML:</p> <ul> <li>If the style that uses the type is the only style used by an application, it's enough to register it with the QML engine via <a href="qqmlengine#qmlRegisterType-1">qmlRegisterType</a>():<pre data-language="cpp">qmlRegisterType&lt;ACoolCppItem&gt;("MyApp", 1, 0, "ACoolItem");</pre> <p>See <a href="qtquickcontrols2-gettingstarted#using-c-data-from-qml">Using C++ Data From QML</a> for more information about this.</p> </li> <li>If the style that uses the type is one of many styles used by an application, it may be better to only register it when necessary. This is the point at which it would make sense to implement your own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtqml-modules-cppplugins.html">QML plugin</a>.<p>Using a plugin as part of your style is not that much different from using a set of QML files. The only difference is that the plugin and its <code>qmldir</code> file must be present in the same directory as the QML files.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="considerations-for-custom-styles">Considerations for custom styles
</h4> <p>When implementing your own style and customizing controls, there are some points to keep in mind to ensure that your application is as performant as possible.</p> <h5 id="avoid-assigning-an-id-to-styles-implementations-of-item-delegates">Avoid assigning an id to styles' implementations of item delegates
</h5> <p>As explained in <a href="qtquickcontrols2-customize#definition-of-a-style">Definition of a Style</a>, when you implement your own style for a control, you start off with the relevant template for that control. For example, a style's <code>Button.qml</code> will be structured similarly to this:</p> <pre data-language="qml">T.Button {
    // ...

    background: Rectangle {
        // ...
    }

    contentItem: Text {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}</pre> <p>When you use a Button in your application, the <code>background</code> and <code>contentItem</code> items will be created and parented to the root <code>Button</code> item:</p> <pre data-language="qml">// Creates the Button root item, the Rectangle background,
// and the Text contentItem.
Button {
    text: qsTr("Confirm")
}</pre> <p>Suppose you then needed to do a one-off customization of the Button (as explained in <a href="qtquickcontrols2-customize#customizing-a-control">Customizing a Control</a>):</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {
    width: 400
    height: 400
    visible: true

    Button {
        id: button
        text: "A Special Button"
        background: Rectangle {
            implicitWidth: 100
            implicitHeight: 40
            color: button.down ? "#d6d6d6" : "#f6f6f6"
            border.color: "#26282a"
            border.width: 1
            radius: 4
        }
    }
}</pre> <p>In QML, this would normally result in both the default <code>background</code> implementation and the one-off, custom <code>background</code> items being created. Qt Quick Controls uses a technique that avoids creating both items, and instead only creates the custom <code>background</code>, greatly improving the creation performance of controls.</p> <p>This technique relies on the absence of an <a href="qtqml-syntax-objectattributes#the-id-attribute">id</a> in the style's implementation of that item. If an id is assigned, the technique cannot work, and both items will be created. For example, it can be tempting to assign an id to the <code>background</code> or <code>contentItem</code> so that other objects within the file can refer to those items:</p> <pre data-language="qml">T.Button {
    // ...

    background: Rectangle {
        id: backgroundRect
        // ...
    }

    contentItem: Text {
        // Use backgroundRect in some way...
    }

    // ...
}</pre> <p>With this code, every time a Button instance with a customized background is created, both backgrounds will be created, resulting in sub-optimal creation performance.</p> <p>Prior to Qt 5.15, the old, unused background would be deleted to release the resources associated with it. However, as the control does not own the items, it should not delete them. As of Qt 5.15, old items are no longer deleted, and so the <code>backgroundRect</code> item will live longer than it needs to—typically until the application exits. Although the old item will be hidden, visually unparented from the control, and removed from the accessibility tree, it is important to keep the creation time and memory usage of these unused items in mind when assigning an id in this context.</p> <h5 id="avoid-imperative-assignments-of-custom-items">Avoid imperative assignments of custom items
</h5> <p>The technique mentioned in the section above only works when an item is <a href="qtquick-bestpractices#prefer-declarative-bindings-over-imperative-assignments">declaratively</a> assigned for the first time, and so imperative assignments will result in orphaned items. Always use declarative bindings to assign custom items when possible.</p> <h4 id="attached-properties">Attached properties
</h4> <p>It is common for a style to have certain properties or attributes that apply to all controls. <a href="qtqml-syntax-objectattributes#attached-properties-and-attached-signal-handlers">Attached properties</a> are a great way of extending an item in QML without having to modify any existing C++ belonging to that item. For example, both the <a href="qtquickcontrols2-material">Material</a> and <a href="qtquickcontrols2-universal">Universal</a> styles have an attached theme property that controls whether an item and its children will be rendered in a light or dark theme.</p> <p>As an example, let's add an attached property that controls elevation. Our style will illustrate the elevation with a drop shadow; the higher the elevation, the larger the shadow.</p> <p>The first step is to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-creating.html#selecting-project-type">create a new Qt Quick Controls application</a> in Qt Creator. After that, we <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-creating.html#creating-c-classes">add a C++ type</a> that stores the elevation. Since the type will be used for every control supported by our style, and because we may wish to add other attached properties later on, we'll call it MyStyle. Here is <code>MyStyle.h</code>:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">#ifndef MYSTYLE_H
#define MYSTYLE_H

#include &lt;QObject&gt;
#include &lt;QtQml&gt;

class MyStyle : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(int elevation READ elevation WRITE setElevation NOTIFY elevationChanged)

public:
    explicit MyStyle(QObject *parent = nullptr);

    static MyStyle *qmlAttachedProperties(QObject *object);

    int elevation() const;
    void setElevation(int elevation);

signals:
    void elevationChanged();

private:
    int m_elevation;
};

QML_DECLARE_TYPEINFO(MyStyle, QML_HAS_ATTACHED_PROPERTIES)

#endif // MYSTYLE_H</pre> <p><code>MyStyle.cpp</code>:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">#include "mystyle.h"

MyStyle::MyStyle(QObject *parent) :
    QObject(parent),
    m_elevation(0)
{
}

MyStyle *MyStyle::qmlAttachedProperties(QObject *object)
{
    return new MyStyle(object);
}

int MyStyle::elevation() const
{
    return m_elevation;
}

void MyStyle::setElevation(int elevation)
{
    if (elevation == m_elevation)
        return;

    m_elevation = elevation;
    emit elevationChanged();
}</pre> <p>The <code>MyStyle</code> type is special in the sense that it shouldn't be instantiated, but rather used for its attached properties. For that reason, we register it in the following manner in <code>main.cpp</code>:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">#include &lt;QGuiApplication&gt;
#include &lt;QQmlApplicationEngine&gt;

#include "mystyle.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

    qmlRegisterUncreatableType&lt;MyStyle&gt;("MyStyle", 1, 0, "MyStyle", "MyStyle is an attached property");

    QQmlApplicationEngine engine;
    // Make the directory containing our style known to the QML engine.
    engine.addImportPath(":/");
    engine.load(QUrl(QLatin1String("qrc:/main.qml")));

    return app.exec();
}</pre> <p>We then copy <code>Button.qml</code> from the Basic style in <code>$QTDIR/qml/QtQuick/Controls/Basic/</code> into a new <code>myproject</code> folder in our project directory. Add the newly copied <code>Button.qml</code> to <code>qml.qrc</code>, which is the resource file that contains our QML files.</p> <p>Next, we add a drop shadow to the <a href="qml-qtquick-controls2-control#background-prop">background</a> delegate of the Button:</p> <pre data-language="cpp">// ...
import QtGraphicalEffects
import MyStyle
// ...

background: Rectangle {
    // ...

    layer.enabled: control.enabled &amp;&amp; control.MyStyle.elevation &gt; 0
    layer.effect: DropShadow {
        verticalOffset: 1
        color: control.visualFocus ? "#330066ff" : "#aaaaaa"
        samples: control.MyStyle.elevation
        spread: 0.5
    }
}</pre> <p>Note that we:</p> <ul> <li>Don't bother using the drop shadow when the elevation is <code>0</code>
</li> <li>Change the shadow's color depending on whether or not the button has focus</li> <li>Make the size of the shadow depend on the elevation</li> </ul> <p>To try out the attached property, we create a <a href="qml-qtquick-row">Row</a> with two Buttons in <code>main.qml</code>:</p> <pre data-language="qml">import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

import MyStyle 1.0

ApplicationWindow {
    id: window
    width: 400
    height: 400
    visible: true

    Row {
        spacing: 20
        anchors.centerIn: parent

        Button {
            text: "Button 1"
        }
        Button {
            text: "Button 2"
            MyStyle.elevation: 10
        }

<p>Note that the <code>import MyStyle 1.0</code> statement is only necessary because we are using the attached property belonging to <code>MyStyle</code>. Both buttons will use our custom style, even if we were to remove the import.</p> <h2 id="customization-reference">Customization Reference
</h2> <p>The following snippets present examples where the Basic style's controls have been customized using the same approach as the <a href="qtquickcontrols2-customize#customizing-a-control">Customizing a Control</a> section. The code can be used as a starting point to implement a custom look and feel.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p><b>Note: </b>The <a href="qtquickcontrols2-macos">macOS</a> and <a href="qtquickcontrols2-windows">Windows</a> styles are not suitable for customizing. It is instead recommended to always base a customized control on top of a single style that is available on all platforms, e.g <a href="qtquickcontrols2-basic">Basic Style</a>, <a href="qtquickcontrols2-fusion">Fusion Style</a>, <a href="qtquickcontrols2-imagine">Imagine Style</a>, <a href="qtquickcontrols2-material">Material Style</a>, <a href="qtquickcontrols2-universal">Universal Style</a>. By doing so, you are guaranteed that it will always look the same, regardless of which style the application is run with. For example:</p> </div> <pre data-language="cpp">import QtQuick.Controls.Basic as Basic
