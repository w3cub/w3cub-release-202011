<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlebcdic - Considerations for running Perl on EBCDIC platforms</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>An exploration of some of the issues facing Perl programmers on EBCDIC based computers.</p> <p>Portions of this document that are still incomplete are marked with XXX.</p> <p>Early Perl versions worked on some EBCDIC machines, but the last known version that ran on EBCDIC was v5.8.7, until v5.22, when the Perl core again works on z/OS. Theoretically, it could work on OS/400 or Siemens' BS2000 (or their successors), but this is untested. In v5.22, not all the modules found on CPAN but shipped with core Perl work on z/OS.</p> <p>If you want to use Perl on a non-z/OS EBCDIC machine, please let us know by sending mail to perlbug@perl.org</p> <p>Writing Perl on an EBCDIC platform is really no different than writing on an <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> one, but with different underlying numbers, as we'll see shortly. You'll have to know something about those <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> platforms because the documentation is biased and will frequently use example numbers that don't apply to EBCDIC. There are also very few CPAN modules that are written for EBCDIC and which don't work on ASCII; instead the vast majority of CPAN modules are written for ASCII, and some may happen to work on EBCDIC, while a few have been designed to portably work on both.</p> <p>If your code just uses the 52 letters A-Z and a-z, plus SPACE, the digits 0-9, and the punctuation characters that Perl uses, plus a few controls that are denoted by escape sequences like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">n</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">t</span></code> , then there's nothing special about using Perl, and your code may very well work on an ASCII machine without change.</p> <p>But if you write code that uses <code class="inline">\<span class="n">005</span></code> to mean a TAB or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xC1</span></code> to mean an "A", or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> to mean a "ÿ" (small <code class="inline"><span class="q">"y"</span></code> with a diaeresis), then your code may well work on your EBCDIC platform, but not on an ASCII one. That's fine to do if no one will ever want to run your code on an ASCII platform; but the bias in this document will be in writing code portable between EBCDIC and ASCII systems. Again, if every character you care about is easily enterable from your keyboard, you don't have to know anything about ASCII, but many keyboards don't easily allow you to directly enter, say, the character <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> , so you have to specify it indirectly, such as by using the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\xDF"</span></code> escape sequence. In those cases it's easiest to know something about the ASCII/Unicode character sets. If you know that the small "ÿ" is <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">00</span><span class="w">FF</span></code> , then you can instead specify it as <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\N{U+FF}"</span></code> , and have the computer automatically translate it to <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> on your platform, and leave it as <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xFF</span></code> on ASCII ones. Or you could specify it by name, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">LATIN</span>
<span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">Y</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code> and not have to know the numbers. Either way works, but require familiarity with Unicode.</p> <h2 id="COMMON-CHARACTER-CODE-SETS">COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS</h2> <h3 id="ASCII">ASCII</h3> <p>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII or US-ASCII) is a set of integers running from 0 to 127 (decimal) that have standardized interpretations by the computers which use ASCII. For example, 65 means the letter "A". The range 0..127 can be covered by setting the bits in a 7-bit binary digit, hence the set is sometimes referred to as "7-bit ASCII". ASCII was described by the American National Standards Institute document ANSI X3.4-1986. It was also described by ISO 646:1991 (with localization for currency symbols). The full ASCII set is given in the table <a href="#recipe-3">below</a> as the first 128 elements. Languages that can be written adequately with the characters in ASCII include English, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Swahili and some Native American languages.</p> <p>Most non-EBCDIC character sets are supersets of ASCII. That is the integers 0-127 mean what ASCII says they mean. But integers 128 and above are specific to the character set.</p> <p>Many of these fit entirely into 8 bits, using ASCII as 0-127, while specifying what 128-255 mean, and not using anything above 255. Thus, these are single-byte (or octet if you prefer) character sets. One important one (since Unicode is a superset of it) is the ISO 8859-1 character set.</p> <h3 id="ISO-8859">ISO 8859</h3> <p>The ISO 8859-<i><b>$n</b></i> are a collection of character code sets from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), each of which adds characters to the ASCII set that are typically found in various languages, many of which are based on the Roman, or Latin, alphabet. Most are for European languages, but there are also ones for Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Thai. There are good references on the web about all these.</p> <h3 id="Latin-1-(ISO-8859-1)">Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)</h3> <p>A particular 8-bit extension to ASCII that includes grave and acute accented Latin characters. Languages that can employ ISO 8859-1 include all the languages covered by ASCII as well as Afrikaans, Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Faroese, Finnish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Dutch is covered albeit without the ij ligature. French is covered too but without the oe ligature. German can use ISO 8859-1 but must do so without German-style quotation marks. This set is based on Western European extensions to ASCII and is commonly encountered in world wide web work. In IBM character code set identification terminology, ISO 8859-1 is also known as CCSID 819 (or sometimes 0819 or even 00819).</p> <h3 id="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</h3> <p>The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code refers to a large collection of single- and multi-byte coded character sets that are quite different from ASCII and ISO 8859-1, and are all slightly different from each other; they typically run on host computers. The EBCDIC encodings derive from 8-bit byte extensions of Hollerith punched card encodings, which long predate ASCII. The layout on the cards was such that high bits were set for the upper and lower case alphabetic characters <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>-z<span class="s">]</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Z</span><span class="s">]</span></code> , but there were gaps within each Latin alphabet range, visible in the table <a href="#recipe-3">below</a>. These gaps can cause complications.</p> <p>Some IBM EBCDIC character sets may be known by character code set identification numbers (CCSID numbers) or code page numbers.</p> <p>Perl can be compiled on platforms that run any of three commonly used EBCDIC character sets, listed below.</p> <h4 id="The-13-variant-characters">The 13 variant characters</h4> <p>Among IBM EBCDIC character code sets there are 13 characters that are often mapped to different integer values. Those characters are known as the 13 "variant" characters and are:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">\ [ ] { } ^ ~ ! # | $ @ `
</pre>
<p>When Perl is compiled for a platform, it looks at all of these characters to guess which EBCDIC character set the platform uses, and adapts itself accordingly to that platform. If the platform uses a character set that is not one of the three Perl knows about, Perl will either fail to compile, or mistakenly and silently choose one of the three.</p> <h4 id="EBCDIC-code-sets-recognized-by-Perl">EBCDIC code sets recognized by Perl</h4> <ul> <li id="*0037*">
<b><b>0037</b></b> <p>Character code set ID 0037 is a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1 characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 0037 is used in North American English locales on the OS/400 operating system that runs on AS/400 computers. CCSID 0037 differs from ISO 8859-1 in 236 places; in other words they agree on only 20 code point values.</p> </li> <li id="*1047*">
<b><b>1047</b></b> <p>Character code set ID 1047 is also a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1 characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 1047 is used under Unix System Services for OS/390 or z/OS, and OpenEdition for VM/ESA. CCSID 1047 differs from CCSID 0037 in eight places, and from ISO 8859-1 in 236.</p> </li> <li id="*POSIX-BC*">
<b><b>POSIX-BC</b></b> <p>The EBCDIC code page in use on Siemens' BS2000 system is distinct from 1047 and 0037. It is identified below as the POSIX-BC set. Like 0037 and 1047, it is the same as ISO 8859-1 in 20 code point values.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Unicode-code-points-versus-EBCDIC-code-points">Unicode code points versus EBCDIC code points</h3> <p>In Unicode terminology a <i>code point</i> is the number assigned to a character: for example, in EBCDIC the character "A" is usually assigned the number 193. In Unicode, the character "A" is assigned the number 65. All the code points in ASCII and Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) have the same meaning in Unicode. All three of the recognized EBCDIC code sets have 256 code points, and in each code set, all 256 code points are mapped to equivalent Latin1 code points. Obviously, "A" will map to "A", "B" =&gt; "B", "%" =&gt; "%", etc., for all printable characters in Latin1 and these code pages.</p> <p>It also turns out that EBCDIC has nearly precise equivalents for the ASCII/Latin1 C0 controls and the DELETE control. (The C0 controls are those whose ASCII code points are 0..0x1F; things like TAB, ACK, BEL, etc.) A mapping is set up between these ASCII/EBCDIC controls. There isn't such a precise mapping between the C1 controls on ASCII platforms and the remaining EBCDIC controls. What has been done is to map these controls, mostly arbitrarily, to some otherwise unmatched character in the other character set. Most of these are very very rarely used nowadays in EBCDIC anyway, and their names have been dropped, without much complaint. For example the EO (Eight Ones) EBCDIC control (consisting of eight one bits = 0xFF) is mapped to the C1 APC control (0x9F), and you can't use the name "EO".</p> <p>The EBCDIC controls provide three possible line terminator characters, CR (0x0D), LF (0x25), and NL (0x15). On ASCII platforms, the symbols "NL" and "LF" refer to the same character, but in strict EBCDIC terminology they are different ones. The EBCDIC NL is mapped to the C1 control called "NEL" ("Next Line"; here's a case where the mapping makes quite a bit of sense, and hence isn't just arbitrary). On some EBCDIC platforms, this NL or NEL is the typical line terminator. This is true of z/OS and BS2000. In these platforms, the C compilers will swap the LF and NEL code points, so that <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> is 0x15, and refers to NL. Perl does that too; you can see it in the code chart <a href="#recipe-3">below</a>. This makes things generally "just work" without you even having to be aware that there is a swap.</p> <h3 id="Unicode-and-UTF">Unicode and UTF</h3> <p>UTF stands for "Unicode Transformation Format". UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode into a sequence of 8-bit byte chunks, based on ASCII and Latin-1. The length of a sequence required to represent a Unicode code point depends on the ordinal number of that code point, with larger numbers requiring more bytes. UTF-EBCDIC is like UTF-8, but based on EBCDIC. They are enough alike that often, casual usage will conflate the two terms, and use "UTF-8" to mean both the UTF-8 found on ASCII platforms, and the UTF-EBCDIC found on EBCDIC ones.</p> <p>You may see the term "invariant" character or code point. This simply means that the character has the same numeric value and representation when encoded in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) as when not. (Note that this is a very different concept from <a href="#The-13-variant-characters">The 13 variant characters</a> mentioned above. Careful prose will use the term "UTF-8 invariant" instead of just "invariant", but most often you'll see just "invariant".) For example, the ordinal value of "A" is 193 in most EBCDIC code pages, and also is 193 when encoded in UTF-EBCDIC. All UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) variant code points occupy at least two bytes when encoded in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC); by definition, the UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) invariant code points are exactly one byte whether encoded in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC), or not. (By now you see why people typically just say "UTF-8" when they also mean "UTF-EBCDIC". For the rest of this document, we'll mostly be casual about it too.) In ASCII UTF-8, the code points corresponding to the lowest 128 ordinal numbers (0 - 127: the ASCII characters) are invariant. In UTF-EBCDIC, there are 160 invariant characters. (If you care, the EBCDIC invariants are those characters which have ASCII equivalents, plus those that correspond to the C1 controls (128 - 159 on ASCII platforms).)</p> <p>A string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may be longer (but never shorter) than one encoded in UTF-8. Perl extends UTF-8 so that it can encode code points above the Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF. It extends UTF-EBCDIC as well, but due to the inherent limitations in UTF-EBCDIC, the maximum code point expressible is U+7FFF_FFFF, even if the word size is more than 32 bits.</p> <p>UTF-EBCDIC is defined by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/http:#%2fwww.unicode.org%2freports%2ftr16">Unicode Technical Report #16</a>. It is defined based on CCSID 1047, not allowing for the differences for other code pages. This allows for easy interchange of text between computers running different code pages, but makes it unusable, without adaptation, for Perl on those other code pages.</p> <p>The reason for this unusability is that a fundamental assumption of Perl is that the characters it cares about for parsing and lexical analysis are the same whether or not the text is in UTF-8. For example, Perl expects the character <code class="inline"><span class="q">"["</span></code> to have the same representation, no matter if the string containing it (or program text) is UTF-8 encoded or not. To ensure this, Perl adapts UTF-EBCDIC to the particular code page so that all characters it expects to be UTF-8 invariant are in fact UTF-8 invariant. This means that text generated on a computer running one version of Perl's UTF-EBCDIC has to be translated to be intelligible to a computer running another.</p> <h3 id="Using-Encode">Using Encode</h3> <p>Starting from Perl 5.8 you can use the standard module Encode to translate from EBCDIC to Latin-1 code points. Encode knows about more EBCDIC character sets than Perl can currently be compiled to run on.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode 'from_to';

my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

# $a is in EBCDIC code points
from_to($a, $ebcdic{ord '^'}, 'latin1');
# $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
</pre>
<p>and from Latin-1 code points to EBCDIC code points</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode 'from_to';

my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

# $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
from_to($a, 'latin1', $ebcdic{ord '^'});
# $a is in EBCDIC code points
</pre>
<p>For doing I/O it is suggested that you use the autotranslating features of PerlIO, see <a href="perluniintro">perluniintro</a>.</p> <p>Since version 5.8 Perl uses the PerlIO I/O library. This enables you to use different encodings per IO channel. For example you may use</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode;
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(cp37)", "test.ebcdic");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
</pre>
<p>to get four files containing "Hello World!\n" in ASCII, CP 0037 EBCDIC, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) (in this example identical to ASCII since only ASCII characters were printed), and UTF-EBCDIC (in this example identical to normal EBCDIC since only characters that don't differ between EBCDIC and UTF-EBCDIC were printed). See the documentation of <a href="encode/perlio">Encode::PerlIO</a> for details.</p> <p>As the PerlIO layer uses raw IO (bytes) internally, all this totally ignores things like the type of your filesystem (ASCII or EBCDIC).</p> <h2 id="SINGLE-OCTET-TABLES">SINGLE OCTET TABLES</h2> <p>The following tables list the ASCII and Latin 1 ordered sets including the subsets: C0 controls (0..31), ASCII graphics (32..7e), delete (7f), C1 controls (80..9f), and Latin-1 (a.k.a. ISO 8859-1) (a0..ff). In the table names of the Latin 1 extensions to ASCII have been labelled with character names roughly corresponding to <i>The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1</i> albeit with substitutions such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s">s/LATIN//</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s">s/VULGAR//</a></code> in all cases; <code class="inline"><span class="q">s/CAPITAL LETTER//</span></code> in some cases; and <code class="inline"><span class="q">s/SMALL LETTER ([A-Z])/\l$1/</span></code> in some other cases. Controls are listed using their Unicode 6.2 abbreviations. The differences between the 0037 and 1047 sets are flagged with <code class="inline"><span class="i">**</span></code> . The differences between the 1047 and POSIX-BC sets are flagged with <code class="inline"><span class="c">##.</span></code> All <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ord">ord()</a></code> numbers listed are decimal. If you would rather see this table listing octal values, then run the table (that is, the pod source text of this document, since this recipe may not work with a pod2_other_format translation) through:</p> <ul> <li id="recipe-0">
<b>recipe 0</b> </li> </ul> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -ne 'if(/(.{29})(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)/)' \

<h2 id="IDENTIFYING-CHARACTER-CODE-SETS">IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS</h2> <p>It is possible to determine which character set you are operating under. But first you need to be really really sure you need to do this. Your code will be simpler and probably just as portable if you don't have to test the character set and do different things, depending. There are actually only very few circumstances where it's not easy to write straight-line code portable to all character sets. See <a href="perluniintro#Unicode-and-EBCDIC">Unicode and EBCDIC in perluniintro</a> for how to portably specify characters.</p> <p>But there are some cases where you may want to know which character set you are running under. One possible example is doing <a href="#SORTING">sorting</a> in inner loops where performance is critical.</p> <p>To determine if you are running under ASCII or EBCDIC, you can use the return value of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ord">ord()</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr()</a></code> to test one or more character values. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii  = "A" eq chr(65);
$is_ebcdic = "A" eq chr(193);
$is_ascii  = ord("A") == 65;
$is_ebcdic = ord("A") == 193;
</pre>
<p>There's even less need to distinguish between EBCDIC code pages, but to do so try looking at one or more of the characters that differ between them.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii           = ord('[') == 91;
$is_ebcdic_37       = ord('[') == 186;
$is_ebcdic_1047     = ord('[') == 173;
$is_ebcdic_POSIX_BC = ord('[') == 187;
</pre>
<p>However, it would be unwise to write tests such as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii = "\r" ne chr(13);  #  WRONG
$is_ascii = "\n" ne chr(10);  #  ILL ADVISED
</pre>
<p>Obviously the first of these will fail to distinguish most ASCII platforms from either a CCSID 0037, a 1047, or a POSIX-BC EBCDIC platform since <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\r"</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eq">eq</a> <a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">13</span><span class="s">)</span></code> under all of those coded character sets. But note too that because <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> is <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr(13)</a></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\r"</span></code> is <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr(10)</a></code> on old Macintosh (which is an ASCII platform) the second <code class="inline"><span class="i">$is_ascii</span></code> test will lead to trouble there.</p> <p>To determine whether or not perl was built under an EBCDIC code page you can use the Config module like so:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Config;
$is_ebcdic = $Config{'ebcdic'} eq 'define';

<p>To convert from EBCDIC 037 to ASCII just reverse the order of the tr/// arguments like so:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $ascii_string = $ebcdic_string;

</pre>
<p>Similarly one could take the output of the third numbers column from recipe 2 to obtain a <code class="inline"><span class="i">$cp_1047</span></code> table. The fourth numbers column of the output from recipe 2 could provide a <code class="inline"><span class="i">$cp_posix_bc</span></code> table suitable for transcoding as well.</p> <p>If you wanted to see the inverse tables, you would first have to sort on the desired numbers column as in recipes 4, 5 or 6, then take the output of the first numbers column.</p> <h3 id="iconv">iconv</h3> <p>XPG operability often implies the presence of an <i>iconv</i> utility available from the shell or from the C library. Consult your system's documentation for information on iconv.</p> <p>On OS/390 or z/OS see the <i>iconv(1)</i> manpage. One way to invoke the <code class="inline"><span class="w">iconv</span></code> shell utility from within perl would be to:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># OS/390 or z/OS example
$ascii_data = `echo '$ebcdic_data'| iconv -f IBM-1047 -t ISO8859-1`
</pre>
<p>or the inverse map:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># OS/390 or z/OS example
$ebcdic_data = `echo '$ascii_data'| iconv -f ISO8859-1 -t IBM-1047`
</pre>
<p>For other Perl-based conversion options see the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Convert::</span>*</code> modules on CPAN.</p> <h3 id="C-RTL">C RTL</h3> <p>The OS/390 and z/OS C run-time libraries provide <code class="inline"><span class="i">_atoe</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">_etoa</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> functions.</p> <h2 id="OPERATOR-DIFFERENCES">OPERATOR DIFFERENCES</h2> <p>The <code class="inline">..</code> range operator treats certain character ranges with care on EBCDIC platforms. For example the following array will have twenty six elements on either an EBCDIC platform or an ASCII platform:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">@alphabet = ('A'..'Z');   #  $#alphabet == 25
</pre>
<p>The bitwise operators such as &amp; ^ | may return different results when operating on string or character data in a Perl program running on an EBCDIC platform than when run on an ASCII platform. Here is an example adapted from the one in <a href="perlop">perlop</a>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># EBCDIC-based examples
print "j p \n" ^ " a h";                      # prints "JAPH\n"
print "JA" | "  ph\n";                        # prints "japh\n"
print "JAPH\nJunk" &amp; "\277\277\277\277\277";  # prints "japh\n";
print 'p N$' ^ " E&lt;H\n";                      # prints "Perl\n";
</pre>
<p>An interesting property of the 32 C0 control characters in the ASCII table is that they can "literally" be constructed as control characters in Perl, e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span></code> eq <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span><span class="i">@</span></code> )&gt; <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">)</span></code> eq <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cA</span></code> )&gt;, and so on. Perl on EBCDIC platforms has been ported to take <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span><span class="i">@</span></code> to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr(0)</a></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cA</span></code> to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr(1)</a></code>, etc. as well, but the characters that result depend on which code page you are using. The table below uses the standard acronyms for the controls. The POSIX-BC and 1047 sets are identical throughout this range and differ from the 0037 set at only one spot (21 decimal). Note that the line terminator character may be generated by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cJ</span></code> on ASCII platforms but by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cU</span></code> on 1047 or POSIX-BC platforms and cannot be generated as a <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\c.letter."</span></code> control character on 0037 platforms. Note also that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span>\</code> cannot be the final element in a string or regex, as it will absorb the terminator. But <code class="inline">\c\<i>X</i></code> is a <code class="inline"><span class="w">FILE</span>
<span class="w">SEPARATOR</span></code> concatenated with <i>X</i> for all <i>X</i>. The outlier <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span>?</code> on ASCII, which yields a non-C0 control <code class="inline"><span class="w">DEL</span></code> , yields the outlier control <code class="inline"><span class="w">APC</span></code> on EBCDIC, the one that isn't in the block of contiguous controls. Note that a subtlety of this is that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span>?</code> on ASCII platforms is an ASCII character, while it isn't equivalent to any ASCII character in EBCDIC platforms.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chr   ord   8859-1    0037    1047 &amp;&amp; POSIX-BC

But keep in mind that using octal or hex notation to specify a particular code point will give you the character that the EBCDIC code page natively maps to it. (This is also true of all double-quoted strings.) If you want to write portably, just use the <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+...<span class="s">}</span></code> notation everywhere where you would have used <code class="inline">\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> , and don't use octal notation at all.</p> <p>Starting in Perl v5.22, this applies to ranges in bracketed character classes. If you say, for example, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr">qr/[\N{U+20}-\N{U+7F}]/</a></code>, it means the characters <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">20</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">21</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , ..., <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">7</span><span class="w">F</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . This range is all the printable characters that the ASCII character set contains.</p> <p>Prior to v5.22, you couldn't specify any ranges portably, except (starting in Perl v5.5.3) all subsets of the <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Z</span><span class="s">]</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>-z<span class="s">]</span></code> ranges are specially coded to not pick up gap characters. For example, characters such as "ô" (<code class="inline"><span class="w">o</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">CIRCUMFLEX</span></code> ) that lie between "I" and "J" would not be matched by the regular expression range <code class="inline"><span class="q">/[H-K]/</span></code> . But if either of the range end points is explicitly numeric (and neither is specified by <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+...<span class="s">}</span></code> ), the gap characters are matched:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/[\x89-\x91]/
</pre>
<p>will match <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x8e</span></code> , even though <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x89</span></code> is "i" and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x91</span> </code> is "j", and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x8e</span></code> is a gap character, from the alphabetic viewpoint.</p> <p>Another construct to be wary of is the inappropriate use of hex (unless you use <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+...<span class="s">}</span></code> ) or octal constants in regular expressions. Consider the following set of subs:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub is_c0 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\000-\037]/;
}

sub is_print_ascii {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\040-\176]/;
}

sub is_delete {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char eq "\177";
}

sub is_c1 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\200-\237]/;
}

sub is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\240-\377]/;
}
</pre>
<p>These are valid only on ASCII platforms. Starting in Perl v5.22, simply changing the octal constants to equivalent <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+...<span class="s">}</span></code> values makes them portable:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub is_c0 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\N{U+00}-\N{U+1F}]/;
}

sub is_print_ascii {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\N{U+20}-\N{U+7E}]/;
}

sub is_delete {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char eq "\N{U+7F}";
}

sub is_c1 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\N{U+80}-\N{U+9F}]/;
}

sub is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\N{U+A0}-\N{U+FF}]/;
}
</pre>
<p>And here are some alternative portable ways to write them:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub Is_c0 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return $char =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/a &amp;&amp; ! Is_delete($char);

    # Alternatively:
    # return $char =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/
    #        &amp;&amp; $char =~ /[[:ascii:]]/
    #        &amp;&amp; ! Is_delete($char);
}

sub Is_print_ascii {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);

    return $char =~ /[[:print:]]/a;

    # Alternatively:
    # return $char =~ /[[:print:]]/ &amp;&amp; $char =~ /[[:ascii:]]/;

    # Or
    # return $char
    #      =~ /[ !"\#\$%&amp;'()*+,\-.\/0-9:;&lt;=&gt;?\@A-Z[\\\]^_`a-z{|}~]/;
}

sub Is_delete {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return utf8::native_to_unicode(ord $char) == 0x7F;
}

sub Is_c1 {
    use feature 'unicode_strings';
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return $char =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/ &amp;&amp; $char !~ /[[:ascii:]]/;
}

sub Is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
    use feature 'unicode_strings';
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return ord($char) &lt; 256
           &amp;&amp; $char !~ /[[:ascii:]]/
           &amp;&amp; $char !~ /[[:cntrl:]]/;
}
</pre>
<p>Another way to write <code class="inline"><span class="i">Is_latin_1</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> would be to use the characters in the range explicitly:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub Is_latin_1 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[ ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬­®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏ]
                                [ÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõö÷øùúûüýþÿ]/x;
}
</pre>
<p>Although that form may run into trouble in network transit (due to the presence of 8 bit characters) or on non ISO-Latin character sets. But it does allow <code class="inline"><span class="w">Is_c1</span></code> to be rewritten so it works on Perls that don't have <code class="inline"><span class="q">'unicode_strings'</span></code> (earlier than v5.14):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub Is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return ord($char) &lt; 256
           &amp;&amp; $char !~ /[[:ascii:]]/
           &amp;&amp; ! Is_latin1($char);
}
</pre>
<h2 id="SOCKETS">SOCKETS</h2> <p>Most socket programming assumes ASCII character encodings in network byte order. Exceptions can include CGI script writing under a host web server where the server may take care of translation for you. Most host web servers convert EBCDIC data to ISO-8859-1 or Unicode on output.</p> <h2 id="SORTING">SORTING</h2> <p>One big difference between ASCII-based character sets and EBCDIC ones are the relative positions of the characters when sorted in native order. Of most concern are the upper- and lowercase letters, the digits, and the underscore (<code class="inline"><span class="q">"_"</span></code> ). On ASCII platforms the native sort order has the digits come before the uppercase letters which come before the underscore which comes before the lowercase letters. On EBCDIC, the underscore comes first, then the lowercase letters, then the uppercase ones, and the digits last. If sorted on an ASCII-based platform, the two-letter abbreviation for a physician comes before the two letter abbreviation for drive; that is:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">@sorted = sort(qw(Dr. dr.));  # @sorted holds ('Dr.','dr.') on ASCII,
                                 # but ('dr.','Dr.') on EBCDIC
</pre>
<p>The property of lowercase before uppercase letters in EBCDIC is even carried to the Latin 1 EBCDIC pages such as 0037 and 1047. An example would be that "Ë" (<code class="inline"><span class="w">E</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code> , 203) comes before "ë" (<code class="inline"><span class="w">e</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code> , 235) on an ASCII platform, but the latter (83) comes before the former (115) on an EBCDIC platform. (Astute readers will note that the uppercase version of "ß" <code class="inline"><span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">SHARP</span> <span class="w">S</span></code> is simply "SS" and that the upper case versions of "ÿ" (small <code class="inline">y WITH DIAERESIS</code>) and "µ" (<code class="inline"><span class="w">MICRO</span> <span class="w">SIGN</span></code> ) are not in the 0..255 range but are in Unicode, in a Unicode enabled Perl).</p> <p>The sort order will cause differences between results obtained on ASCII platforms versus EBCDIC platforms. What follows are some suggestions on how to deal with these differences.</p> <h3 id="Ignore-ASCII-vs.-EBCDIC-sort-differences.">Ignore ASCII vs. EBCDIC sort differences.</h3> <p>This is the least computationally expensive strategy. It may require some user education.</p> <h3 id="Use-a-sort-helper-function">Use a sort helper function</h3> <p>This is completely general, but the most computationally expensive strategy. Choose one or the other character set and transform to that for every sort comparision. Here's a complete example that transforms to ASCII sort order:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub native_to_uni($) {
   my $string = shift;

   # Saves time on an ASCII platform
   return $string if ord 'A' ==  65;

   my $output = "";
   for my $i (0 .. length($string) - 1) {
       $output
          .= chr(utf8::native_to_unicode(ord(substr($string, $i, 1))));
   }

   # Preserve utf8ness of input onto the output, even if it didn't need
   # to be utf8
   utf8::upgrade($output) if utf8::is_utf8($string);

   return $output;
}

sub ascii_order {   # Sort helper
   return native_to_uni($a) cmp native_to_uni($b);
}

sort ascii_order @list;
</pre>
<h3 id="MONO-CASE-then-sort-data-(for-non-digits%2c-non-underscore)">MONO CASE then sort data (for non-digits, non-underscore)</h3> <p>If you don't care about where digits and underscore sort to, you can do something like this</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub case_insensitive_order {   # Sort helper
   return lc($a) cmp lc($b)
}

sort case_insensitive_order @list;
</pre>
<p>If performance is an issue, and you don't care if the output is in the same case as the input, Use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr///</a></code> to transform to the case most employed within the data. If the data are primarily UPPERCASE non-Latin1, then apply <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr/[a-z]/[A-Z]/</a></code>, and then <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort">sort()</a></code>. If the data are primarily lowercase non Latin1 then apply <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr/[A-Z]/[a-z]/</a></code> before sorting.

tr/[àáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþ]/[ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞ/;
s/ß/SS/g;
</pre>
<p>then <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort">sort()</a></code>. If you have a choice, it's better to lowercase things to avoid the problems of the two Latin-1 characters whose uppercase is outside Latin-1: "ÿ" (small <code class="inline">y WITH DIAERESIS</code>) and "µ" (<code class="inline"><span class="w">MICRO</span> <span class="w">SIGN</span></code> ). If you do need to upppercase, you can; with a Unicode-enabled Perl, do:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tr/ÿ/\x{178}/;
tr/µ/\x{39C}/;

A single alphabet shift is sometimes referred to as a rotation and the shift amount is given as a number $n after the string 'rot' or "rot$n". Rot0 and rot26 would designate identity maps on the 26-letter English version of the Latin alphabet. Rot13 has the interesting property that alternate subsequent invocations are identity maps (thus rot13 is its own non-trivial inverse in the group of 26 alphabet rotations).
