<h1>Wagtail’s release process</h1> <section id="official-releases"> <h2>Official releases</h2> <p>Release numbering works as follows:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Versions are numbered in the form <code>A.B</code> or <code>A.B.C</code>.</li> <li>
<code>A.B</code> is the <em>feature release</em> version number. Each version will be mostly backwards compatible with the previous release. Exceptions to this rule will be listed in the release notes.</li> <li>
<code>C</code> is the <em>patch release</em> version number, which is incremented for bugfix and security releases. These releases will be 100% backwards-compatible with the previous patch release. The only exception is when a security or data loss issue can’t be fixed without breaking backwards-compatibility. If this happens, the release notes will provide detailed upgrade instructions.</li> <li>Before a new feature release, we’ll make at least one release candidate release. These are of the form <code>A.BrcN</code>, which means the <code>Nth</code> release candidate of version <code>A.B</code>.</li> </ul> <p>In git, each Wagtail release will have a tag indicating its version number. Additionally, each release series has its own branch, called <code>stable/A.B.x</code>, and bugfix/security releases will be issued from those branches.</p> <p><strong>Feature release</strong></p> <p>Feature releases (A.B, A.B+1, etc.) happen every three months – see <a class="reference internal" href="#release-schedule"><span class="std std-ref">release schedule</span></a> for details. These releases will contain new features and improvements to existing features.</p> <p><strong>Patch release</strong></p> <p>Patch releases (A.B.C, A.B.C+1, etc.) will be issued as needed, to fix bugs and/or security issues.</p> <p>These releases will be 100% compatible with the associated feature release, unless this is impossible for security reasons or to prevent data loss. So the answer to “should I upgrade to the latest patch release?” will always be “yes.”</p> <p><strong>Long-term support release</strong></p> <p>Certain feature releases will be designated as long-term support (LTS) releases. These releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically six months.</p> </section> <section id="release-cadence"> <h2>Release cadence</h2> <p>Wagtail uses a loose form of <a class="reference external" href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. SemVer makes it easier to see at a glance how compatible releases are with each other. It also helps to anticipate when compatibility shims will be removed. It’s not a pure form of SemVer as each feature release will continue to have a few documented backwards incompatibilities where a deprecation path isn’t possible or not worth the cost.</p> </section> <section id="deprecation-policy"> <h2>Deprecation policy</h2> <p>A feature release may deprecate certain features from previous releases. If a feature is deprecated in feature release A.B, it will continue to work in the following version but raise warnings. Features deprecated in release A.B will be removed in the A.B+2 release to ensure deprecations are done over at least 2 feature releases.</p> <p>So, for example, if we decided to start the deprecation of a function in Wagtail 1.4:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Wagtail 1.4 will contain a backwards-compatible replica of the function which will raise a <code>RemovedInWagtail16Warning</code>.</li> <li>Wagtail 1.5 will still contain the backwards-compatible replica.</li> <li>Wagtail 1.6 will remove the feature outright.</li> </ul> <p>The warnings are silent by default. You can turn on display of these warnings with the <code>python -Wd</code> option.</p> </section> <section id="supported-versions"> <h2>Supported versions</h2> <p>At any moment in time, Wagtail’s developer team will support a set of releases to varying levels.</p> <ul> <li>The current development <code>main</code> will get new features and bug fixes requiring non-trivial refactoring.</li> <li>
<p>Patches applied to the <code>main</code> branch must also be applied to the last feature release branch, to be released in the next patch release of that feature series, when they fix critical problems:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Security issues.</li> <li>Data loss bugs.</li> <li>Crashing bugs.</li> <li>Major functionality bugs in newly-introduced features.</li> <li>Regressions from older versions of Wagtail.</li> </ul> <p>The rule of thumb is that fixes will be backported to the last feature release for bugs that would have prevented a release in the first place (release blockers).</p> </li> <li>Security fixes and data loss bugs will be applied to the current <code>main</code>, the last feature release branch, and any other supported long-term support release branches.</li> <li>Documentation fixes generally will be more freely backported to the last release branch. That’s because it’s highly advantageous to have the docs for the last release be up-to-date and correct, and the risk of introducing regressions is much less of a concern.</li> </ul> <p>As a concrete example, consider a moment in time halfway between the release of Wagtail 1.6 and 1.7. At this point in time:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Features will be added to <code>main</code>, to be released as Wagtail 1.7.</li> <li>Critical bug fixes will be applied to the <code>stable/1.6.x</code> branch, and released as 1.6.1, 1.6.2, etc.</li> <li>Security fixes and bug fixes for data loss issues will be applied to <code>main</code> and to the <code>stable/1.6.x</code> and <code>stable/1.4.x</code> (LTS) branches. They will trigger the release of <code>1.6.1</code>, <code>1.4.8</code>, etc.</li> <li>Documentation fixes will be applied to <code>main</code>, and, if easily backported, to the latest stable branch, <code>1.6.x</code>.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="supported-versions-of-django"> <h2>Supported versions of Django</h2> <p>Each release of Wagtail declares which versions of Django it supports.</p> <p>Typically, a new Wagtail feature release supports the last long-term support version and all following versions of Django.</p> <p>For example, consider a moment in time before release of Wagtail 1.5 and after the following releases:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Django 1.8 (LTS)</li> <li>Django 1.9</li> <li>Wagtail 1.4 (LTS) - Released before Django 1.10 and supports Django 1.8 and 1.9</li> <li>Django 1.10</li> </ul> <p>Wagtail 1.5 will support Django 1.8 (LTS), 1.9, 1.10. Wagtail 1.4 will still support only Django 1.8 (LTS) and 1.9.</p> </section> <section id="release-schedule"> <h2 id="id1">Release schedule</h2> <p>Wagtail uses a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Release-schedule">time-based release schedule</a>, with feature releases every three months.</p> <p>After each feature release, the release manager will announce a timeline for the next feature release.</p> <section id="release-cycle"> <h3>Release cycle</h3> <p>Each release cycle consists of three parts:</p> <section id="phase-one-feature-proposal"> <h4>Phase one: feature proposal</h4> <p>The first phase of the release process will include figuring out what major features to include in the next version. This should include a good deal of preliminary work on those features – working code trumps grand design.</p> </section> <section id="phase-two-development"> <h4>Phase two: development</h4> <p>The second part of the release schedule is the “heads-down” working period. Using the roadmap produced at the end of phase one, we’ll all work very hard to get everything on it done.</p> <p>At the end of phase two, any unfinished features will be postponed until the next release.</p> <p>At this point, the <code>stable/A.B.x</code> branch will be forked from <code>main</code>.</p> </section> <section id="phase-three-bugfixes"> <h4>Phase three: bugfixes</h4> <p>The last part of a release cycle is spent fixing bugs – no new features will be accepted during this time.</p> <p>Once all known blocking bugs have been addressed, a release candidate will be made available for testing. The final release will usually follow two weeks later, although this period may be extended if the further release blockers are found.</p> <p>During this phase, committers will be more and more conservative with backports, to avoid introducing regressions. After the release candidate, only release blockers and documentation fixes should be backported.</p> <p>Developers should avoid adding any new translatable strings after the release candidate - this ensures that translators have the full period between the release candidate and the final release to bring translations up to date. Translations will be re-imported immediately before the final release.</p> <p>In parallel to this phase, <code>main</code> can receive new features, to be released in the <code>A.B+1</code> cycle.</p> </section> </section> <section id="bug-fix-releases"> <h3>Bug-fix releases</h3> <p>After a feature release <code>A.B</code>, the previous release will go into bugfix mode.</p> <p>The branch for the previous feature release <code>stable/A.B-1.x</code> will include bugfixes. Critical bugs fixed on <code>main</code> must <em>also</em> be fixed on the bugfix branch; this means that commits need to cleanly separate bug fixes from feature additions. The developer who commits a fix to <code>main</code> will be responsible for also applying the fix to the current bugfix branch.</p> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
