<h1 id="SECTION040180000000000000000">Plot</h1>  <b>plot</b> is the primary command for drawing plots with <b>gnuplot</b>. It offers many different graphical representations for functions and data. <b>plot</b> is used to draw 2D functions and data. <b>splot</b> draws 2D projections of 3D surfaces and data. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
plot {&lt;ranges&gt;} &lt;plot-element&gt; {, &lt;plot-element&gt;, &lt;plot-element&gt;}</pre>  <p> Each plot element consists of a definition, a function, or a data source together with optional properties or modifiers:  </p>
<pre>
plot-element:
     {&lt;iteration&gt;}
     &lt;definition&gt; | {sampling-range} &lt;function&gt; | &lt;data source&gt;
                  | keyentry
     {axes &lt;axes&gt;} {&lt;title-spec&gt;}
     {with &lt;style&gt;}</pre>  <p> The graphical representation of each plot element is determined by the keyword <b>with</b>, e.g. <b>with lines</b> or <b>with boxplot</b>. See <b>plotting styles</b>. </p>
<p> The data to be plotted is either generated by a function (two functions if in parametric mode), read from a data file, or read from a named data block that was defined previously. Multiple datafiles, data blocks, and/or functions may be plotted in a single plot command separated by commas. See <b><a href="plot#data">data</a></b>, <b><a href="inline_data_datablocks#inline_data">inline data</a></b>, <b><a href="plot#functions">functions</a></b>. </p>
<p> A plot-element that contains the definition of a function or variable does not create any visible output, see third example below. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
plot sin(x)
plot sin(x), cos(x)
plot f(x) = sin(x*a), a = .2, f(x), a = .4, f(x)
plot "datafile.1" with lines, "datafile.2" with points
plot [t=1:10] [-pi:pi*2] tan(t), \
     "data.1" using (tan($2)):($3/$4) smooth csplines \
              axes x1y2 notitle with lines 5
plot for [datafile in "spinach.dat broccoli.dat"] datafile</pre>  <p> See also <b><a href="set_show#show_plot">show plot</a></b>. </p>
<h2 id="SECTION040181000000000000000">Axes</h2>  There are four possible sets of axes available; the keyword <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>axes<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is used to select the axes for which a particular line should be scaled. <b>x1y1</b> refers to the axes on the bottom and left; <b>x2y2</b> to those on the top and right; <b>x1y2</b> to those on the bottom and right; and <b>x2y1</b> to those on the top and left. Ranges specified on the <b>plot</b> command apply only to the first set of axes (bottom left). <h2 id="SECTION040182000000000000000">Binary</h2>  BINARY DATA FILES: <p> It is necessary to provide the keyword <b>binary</b> after the filename. Adequate details of the file format must be given on the command line or extracted from the file itself for a supported binary <b>filetype</b>. In particular, there are two structures for binary files, binary matrix format and binary general format. </p>
<p> The <b>binary matrix</b> format contains a two dimensional array of 32 bit IEEE float values plus an additional column and row of coordinate values. In the <b>using</b> specifier of a plot command, column 1 refers to the matrix row coordinate, column 2 refers to the matrix column coordinate, and column 3 refers to the value stored in the array at those coordinates. </p>
<p> The <b>binary general</b> format contains an arbitrary number of columns for which information must be specified at the command line. For example, <b>array</b>, <b>record</b>, <b>format</b> and <b>using</b> can indicate the size, format and dimension of data. There are a variety of useful commands for skipping file headers and changing endianess. There are a set of commands for positioning and translating data since often coordinates are not part of the file when uniform sampling is inherent in the data. Unlike reading from a text or matrix binary file, general binary does not treat the generated columns as 1, 2 or 3 in the <b>using</b> list. Instead column 1 refers to column 1 of the file, or as specified in the <b>format</b> list. </p>
<p> There are global default settings for the various binary options which may be set using the same syntax as the options when used as part of the <b>(s)plot <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>filename<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> binary ...</b> command. This syntax is <b>set datafile binary ...</b>. The general rule is that common command-line specified parameters override file-extracted parameters which override default parameters. </p>
<p> <b>Binary matrix</b> is the default binary format when no keywords specific to <b>binary general</b> are given, i.e., <b>array</b>, <b>record</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>filetype</b>. </p>
<p> General binary data can be entered at the command line via the special file name '-'. However, this is intended for use through a pipe where programs can exchange binary data, not for keyboards. There is no <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>end of record<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> character for binary data. Gnuplot continues reading from a pipe until it has read the number of points declared in the <b>array</b> qualifier. See <b><a href="splot#binary_matrix">binary matrix</a></b> or <b><a href="plot#binary_general">binary general</a></b> for more details. </p>
<p> The <b>index</b> keyword is not supported, since the file format allows only one surface per file. The <b>every</b> and <b>using</b> filters are supported. <b>using</b> operates as if the data were read in the above triplet form. <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/binary.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">Binary File Splot Demo. </span></a> </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040182100000000000000">General</h3> The <b>binary</b> keyword appearing alone indicates a binary data file that contains both coordinate information describing a non-uniform grid and the value of each grid point (see <b><a href="splot#binary_matrix">binary matrix</a></b>). Binary data in any other format requires additional keywords to describe the layout of the data. Unfortunately the syntax of these required additional keywords is convoluted. Nevertheless the general binary mode is particularly useful for application programs sending large amounts of data to gnuplot. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
plot '&lt;file_name&gt;' {binary &lt;binary list&gt;} ...
splot '&lt;file_name&gt;' {binary &lt;binary list&gt;} ...</pre>  <p> General binary format is activated by keywords in <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>binary list<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> pertaining to information about file structure, i.e., <b>array</b>, <b>record</b>, <b>format</b> or <b>filetype</b>. Otherwise, non-uniform matrix binary format is assumed. (See <b><a href="splot#binary_matrix">binary matrix</a></b> for more details.) </p>
<p> NB: In previous versions of gnuplot there have been some differences between the interpretation of binary data keywords by <b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b>. Where the meanings differ, one or both may change in a future gnuplot version. </p>
<p> Gnuplot knows how to read a few standard binary file types that are fully self-describing, e.g. PNG images. Type <b>show datafile binary</b> at the command line for a list. Apart from these, you can think of binary data files as conceptually the same as text data. Each point has columns of information which are selected via the <b>using</b> specification. If no <b>format</b> string is specified, gnuplot will read in a number of binary values equal to the largest column given in the <b><span class="MATH">&lt;</span>using list<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. For example, <b>using 1:3</b> will result in three columns being read, of which the second will be ignored. Certain plot types have an associated default using specification. For example, <b>with image</b> has a default of <b>using 1</b>, while <b>with rgbimage</b> has a default of <b>using 1:2:3</b>. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040182200000000000000">Array</h3> Describes the sampling array dimensions associated with the binary file. The coordinates will be generated by gnuplot. A number must be specified for each dimension of the array. For example, <b>array=(10,20)</b> means the underlying sampling structure is two-dimensional with 10 points along the first (x) dimension and 20 points along the second (y) dimension. A negative number indicates that data should be read until the end of file. If there is only one dimension, the parentheses may be omitted. A colon can be used to separate the dimensions for multiple records. For example, <b>array=25:35</b> indicates there are two one-dimensional records in the file.  <pre>
Note:  Gnuplot version 4.2 used the syntax array=128x128 rather than
       array=(128,128). The older syntax is now deprecated.</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION040182300000000000000">Record</h3> This keyword serves the same function as <b>array</b> and has the same syntax. However, <b>record</b> causes gnuplot to not generate coordinate information. This is for the case where such information may be included in one of the columns of the binary data file. <h3 id="SECTION040182400000000000000">Skip</h3> This keyword allows you to skip sections of a binary file. For instance, if the file contains a 1024 byte header before the start of the data region you would probably want to use  <pre>
plot '&lt;file_name&gt;' binary skip=1024 ...</pre>  If there are multiple records in the file, you may specify a leading offset for each. For example, to skip 512 bytes before the 1st record and 256 bytes before the second and third records  <pre>
plot '&lt;file_name&gt; binary record=356:356:356 skip=512:256:256 ...</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION040182500000000000000">Format</h3> The default binary format is a float. For more flexibility, the format can include details about variable sizes. For example, <b>format=<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%uchar%int%float<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> associates an unsigned character with the first using column, an int with the second column and a float with the third column. If the number of size specifications is less than the greatest column number, the size is implicitly taken to be similar to the last given variable size. <p> Furthermore, similar to the <b>using</b> specification, the format can include discarded columns via the <b>*</b> character and have implicit repetition via a numerical repeat-field. For example, <b>format=<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%*2int%3float<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span></b> causes gnuplot to discard two ints before reading three floats. To list variable sizes, type <b>show datafile binary datasizes</b>. There are a group of names that are machine dependent along with their sizes in bytes for the particular compilation. There is also a group of names which attempt to be machine independent. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040182600000000000000">Endian</h3> Often the endianess of binary data in the file does not agree with the endianess used by the platform on which gnuplot is running. Several words can direct gnuplot how to arrange bytes. For example <b>endian=little</b> means treat the binary file as having byte significance from least to greatest. The options are <pre>
     little:  least significant to greatest significance
        big:  greatest significance to least significance
    default:  assume file endianess is the same as compiler
swap (swab):  Interchange the significance.  (If things
              don't look right, try this.)</pre>  <p> Gnuplot can support <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>middle<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pdp<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) endian if it is compiled with that option. </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040182700000000000000">Filetype</h3>  For some standard binary file formats gnuplot can extract all the necessary information from the file in question. As an example, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>format=edf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> will read ESRF Header File format files. For a list of the currently supported file formats, type <b>show datafile binary filetypes</b>. <p> There is a special file type called <b>auto</b> for which gnuplot will check if the binary file's extension is a quasi-standard extension for a supported format. </p>
<p> Command line keywords may be used to override settings extracted from the file. The settings from the file override any defaults. See <b><a href="set_show#set_datafile_binary">set datafile binary</a></b>. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040182710000000000000">Avs</h4>  <b>avs</b> is one of the automatically recognized binary file types for images. AVS is an extremely simple format, suitable mostly for streaming between applications. It consists of 2 longs (xwidth, ywidth) followed by a stream of pixels, each with four bytes of information alpha/red/green/blue. <h4 id="SECTION040182720000000000000">Edf</h4>   <b>edf</b> is one of the automatically recognized binary file types for images. EDF stands for ESRF Data Format, and it supports both edf and ehf formats (the latter means ESRF Header Format). More information on specifications can be found at <pre>
http://www.edfplus.info/specs</pre>  <h4 id="SECTION040182730000000000000">Png</h4> If gnuplot was configured to use the libgd library for png/gif/jpeg output, then it can also be used to read these same image types as binary files. You can use an explicit command  <pre>
plot 'file.png' binary filetype=png</pre>  Or the file type will be recognized automatically from the extension if you have previously requested  <pre>
set datafile binary filetype=auto</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION040182800000000000000">Keywords</h3> The following keywords apply only when generating coordinates from binary data files. That is, the control mapping the individual elements of a binary array, matrix, or image to specific x/y/z positions. <h4 id="SECTION040182810000000000000">Scan</h4>  A great deal of confusion can arise concerning the relationship between how gnuplot scans a binary file and the dimensions seen on the plot. To lessen the confusion, conceptually think of gnuplot <em>always</em> scanning the binary file point/line/plane or fast/medium/slow. Then this keyword is used to tell gnuplot how to map this scanning convention to the Cartesian convention shown in plots, i.e., x/y/z. The qualifier for scan is a two or three letter code representing where point is assigned (first letter), line is assigned (second letter), and plane is assigned (third letter). For example, <b>scan=yx</b> means the fastest, point-by-point, increment should be mapped along the Cartesian y dimension and the middle, line-by-line, increment should be mapped along the x dimension. <p> When the plotting mode is <b>plot</b>, the qualifier code can include the two letters x and y. For <b>splot</b>, it can include the three letters x, y and z. </p>
<p> There is nothing restricting the inherent mapping from point/line/plane to apply only to Cartesian coordinates. For this reason there are cylindrical coordinate synonyms for the qualifier codes where t (theta), r and z are analogous to the x, y and z of Cartesian coordinates. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040182820000000000000">Transpose</h4>  Shorthand notation for <b>scan=yx</b> or <b>scan=yxz</b>. I.e. it affects the assignment of pixels to scan lines during input. To instead transpose an image when it is displayed try  <pre>
plot 'imagefile' binary filetype=auto flipx rotate=90deg with rgbimage</pre>  <h4 id="SECTION040182830000000000000">Dx, dy, dz</h4>   When gnuplot generates coordinates, it uses the spacing described by these keywords. For example <b>dx=10 dy=20</b> would mean space samples along the x dimension by 10 and space samples along the y dimension by 20. <b>dy</b> cannot appear if <b>dx</b> does not appear. Similarly, <b>dz</b> cannot appear if <b>dy</b> does not appear. If the underlying dimensions are greater than the keywords specified, the spacing of the highest dimension given is extended to the other dimensions. For example, if an image is being read from a file and only <b>dx=3.5</b> is given gnuplot uses a delta x and delta y of 3.5. <p> The following keywords also apply only when generating coordinates. However they may also be used with matrix binary files. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040182840000000000000">Flipx, flipy, flipz</h4>    Sometimes the scanning directions in a binary datafile are not consistent with that assumed by gnuplot. These keywords can flip the scanning direction along dimensions x, y, z. <h4 id="SECTION040182850000000000000">Origin</h4> When gnuplot generates coordinates based upon transposition and flip, it attempts to always position the lower left point in the array at the origin, i.e., the data lies in the first quadrant of a Cartesian system after transpose and flip. <p> To position the array somewhere else on the graph, the <b>origin</b> keyword directs gnuplot to position the lower left point of the array at a point specified by a tuple. The tuple should be a double for <b>plot</b> and a triple for <b>splot</b>. For example, <b>origin=(100,100):(100,200)</b> is for two records in the file and intended for plotting in two dimensions. A second example, <b>origin=(0,0,3.5)</b>, is for plotting in three dimensions. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040182860000000000000">Center</h4>  Similar to <b>origin</b>, this keyword will position the array such that its center lies at the point given by the tuple. For example, <b>center=(0,0)</b>. Center does not apply when the size of the array is <b>Inf</b>. <h4 id="SECTION040182870000000000000">Rotate</h4>  The transpose and flip commands provide some flexibility in generating and orienting coordinates. However, for full degrees of freedom, it is possible to apply a rotational vector described by a rotational angle in two dimensions. <p> The <b>rotate</b> keyword applies to the two-dimensional plane, whether it be <b>plot</b> or <b>splot</b>. The rotation is done with respect to the positive angle of the Cartesian plane. </p>
<p> The angle can be expressed in radians, radians as a multiple of pi, or degrees. For example, <b>rotate=1.5708</b>, <b>rotate=0.5pi</b> and <b>rotate=90deg</b> are equivalent. </p>
<p> If <b>origin</b> is specified, the rotation is done about the lower left sample point before translation. Otherwise, the rotation is done about the array <b>center</b>. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040182880000000000000">Perpendicular</h4>  For <b>splot</b>, the concept of a rotational vector is implemented by a triple representing the vector to be oriented normal to the two-dimensional x-y plane. Naturally, the default is (0,0,1). Thus specifying both rotate and perpendicular together can orient data myriad ways in three-space. <p> The two-dimensional rotation is done first, followed by the three-dimensional rotation. That is, if R' is the rotational 2 x 2 matrix described by an angle, and P is the 3 x 3 matrix projecting (0,0,1) to (xp,yp,zp), let R be constructed from R' at the upper left sub-matrix, 1 at element 3,3 and zeros elsewhere. Then the matrix formula for translating data is v' = P R v, where v is the 3 x 1 vector of data extracted from the data file. In cases where the data of the file is inherently not three-dimensional, logical rules are used to place the data in three-space. (E.g., usually setting the z-dimension value to zero and placing 2D data in the x-y plane.) </p>
<h2 id="SECTION040183000000000000000">Data</h2>     Discrete data contained in a file can be displayed by specifying the name of the data file (enclosed in single or double quotes) on the <b>plot</b> command line. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
plot '&lt;file_name&gt;' {binary &lt;binary list&gt;}
                   {{nonuniform} matrix}
                   {index &lt;index list&gt; | index "&lt;name&gt;"}
                   {every &lt;every list&gt;}
                   {skip &lt;number-of-lines&gt;}
                   {using &lt;using list&gt;}
                   {smooth &lt;option&gt;}
                   {bins &lt;options&gt;}
                   {volatile} {noautoscale}</pre>  <p> The modifiers <b>binary</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>every</b>, <b>skip</b>, <b>using</b>, <b>bins</b>, and <b>smooth</b> are discussed separately. In brief, <b>binary</b> allows data entry from a binary file, <b>index</b> selects which data sets in a multi-data-set file are to be plotted, <b>every</b> specifies which points within a single data set are to be plotted, <b>using</b> determines how the columns within a single record are to be interpreted, and <b>smooth</b> allows for simple interpolation and approximation. <b>bins</b> sorts individual input points into equal-sized intervals along x and plots a single accumulated value per interval. </p>
<p> <b>splot</b> has a similar syntax, but does not support the <b>smooth</b> option. </p>
<p> The <b>noautoscale</b> keyword means that the points making up this plot will be ignored when automatically determining axis range limits. </p>
<p> TEXT DATA FILES: </p>
<p> Data files should contain at least one data point per record (<b>using</b> can select one data point from the record). Records beginning with <b>#</b> (and also with <b>!</b> on VMS) will be treated as comments and ignored. Each data point represents an (x,y) pair. For <b>plot</b>s with error bars or error bars with lines (see <b><a href="set_show#errorbars">errorbars</a></b> or <b><a href="plot#errorlines">errorlines</a></b>), each data point is (x,y,ydelta), (x,y,ylow,yhigh), (x,y,xdelta), (x,y,xlow,xhigh), or (x,y,xlow,xhigh,ylow,yhigh). </p>
<p> In all cases, the numbers of each record of a data file must be separated by white space (one or more blanks or tabs) unless a format specifier is provided by the <b>using</b> option. This white space divides each record into columns. However, whitespace inside a pair of double quotes is ignored when counting columns, so the following datafile line has three columns:  </p>
<pre>
1.0 "second column" 3.0</pre>  <p> Data may be written in exponential format with the exponent preceded by the letter e or E. The fortran exponential specifiers d, D, q, and Q may also be used if the command <b>set datafile fortran</b> is in effect. </p>
<p> Only one column (the y value) need be provided. If x is omitted, <b>gnuplot</b> provides integer values starting at 0. </p>
<p> In datafiles, blank records (records with no characters other than blanks and a newline and/or carriage return) are significant. </p>
<p> Single blank records designate discontinuities in a <b>plot</b>; no line will join points separated by a blank records (if they are plotted with a line style). </p>
<p> Two blank records in a row indicate a break between separate data sets. See <b><a href="plot#index">index</a></b>. </p>
<p> If autoscaling has been enabled (<b>set autoscale</b>), the axes are automatically extended to include all datapoints, with a whole number of tic marks if tics are being drawn. This has two consequences: i) For <b>splot</b>, the corner of the surface may not coincide with the corner of the base. In this case, no vertical line is drawn. ii) When plotting data with the same x range on a dual-axis graph, the x coordinates may not coincide if the x2tics are not being drawn. This is because the x axis has been autoextended to a whole number of tics, but the x2 axis has not. The following example illustrates the problem: </p>
<pre>
reset; plot '-', '-' axes x2y1
1 1
19 19
e
1 1
19 19
e</pre>  <p> To avoid this, you can use the <b>fixmin</b>/<b>fixmax</b> feature of the <b>set autoscale</b> command, which turns off the automatic extension of the axis range up to the next tic mark. </p>
<p> Label coordinates and text can also be read from a data file (see <b><a href="labels#labels">labels</a></b>). </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040183100000000000000">Bins</h3>  EXPERIMENTAL (implementation details may change in a later version)_ Syntax:  <pre>
plot 'DATA' using &lt;XCOL&gt; {:&lt;YCOL&gt;} bins{=&lt;NBINS&gt;}
     {binrange [&lt;LOW&gt;:&lt;HIGH&gt;]} {binwidth=&lt;width&gt;}</pre>  <p> The <b>bins</b> option to a <b>plot</b> command first assigns the original data to equal width bins on x and then plots a single value per bin. The default number of bins is controlled by <b>set samples</b>, but this can be changed by giving an explicit number of bins in the command. </p>
<p> If no binrange is given, the range is taken from the extremes of the x values found in 'DATA'. </p>
<p> Given the range and the number of bins, bin width is calculated automatically and points are assigned to bins 0 to NBINS-1  </p>
<pre>
BINWIDTH = (HIGH - LOW) / (NBINS-1)
xmin = LOW - BINWIDTH/2
xmax = HIGH + BINWIDTH/2
first bin holds points with (xmin &lt;= x &lt; xmin + BINWIDTH)
last bin holds points with (xmax-BINWIDTH &lt;= x &lt; xman)
each point is assigned to bin i = floor(NBINS * (x-xmin)/(xmax-xmin))</pre>  <p> Alternatively you can provide a fixed bin width, in which case nbins is calculated as the smallest number of bins that will span the range. </p>
<p> On output bins are plotted or tabulated by midpoint. E.g. if the program calculates bin width as shown above, the x coordinate output for the first bin is x=LOW (not x=xmin). </p>
<p> If only a single column is given in the using clause then each data point contributes a count of 1 to the accumulation of total counts in the bin for that x coordinate value. If a second column is given then the value in that column is added to the accumulation for the bin. Thus the following two plot command are equivalent:  </p>

If <b>index</b> is not specified, the entire file is plotted as a single data set. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
plot 'file' index 4:5</pre>  <p> For each point in the file, the index value of the data set it appears in is available via the pseudo-column <b>column(-2)</b>. This leads to an alternative way of distinguishing individual data sets within a file as shown below. This is more awkward than the <b>index</b> command if all you are doing is selecting one data set for plotting, but is very useful if you want to assign different properties to each data set. See <b><a href="plot#pseudocolumns">pseudocolumns</a></b>, <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles#lc_variable">lc variable</a></b>. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>

<h3 id="SECTION040183500000000000000">Skip</h3>  The <b>skip</b> keyword tells the program to skip lines at the start of a text (i.e. not binary) data file. The lines that are skipped do not count toward the line count used in processing the <b>every</b> keyword. Note that <b>skip N</b> skips lines only at the start of the file, whereas <b>every ::N</b> skips lines at the start of every block of data in the file. See also <b><a href="plot#binary_skip">binary skip</a></b> for a similar option that applies to binary data files. <h3 id="SECTION040183600000000000000">Smooth</h3>   <b>gnuplot</b> includes a few general-purpose routines for interpolation and approximation of data; these are grouped under the <b>smooth</b> option. More sophisticated data processing may be performed by preprocessing the data externally or by using <b>fit</b> with an appropriate model. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
smooth {unique | frequency | fnormal | cumulative | cnormal | bins
               | kdensity {bandwidth}
               | csplines | acsplines | mcsplines | bezier | sbezier
               | unwrap}</pre>  <p> The <b>unique</b>, <b>frequency</b>, <b>fnormal</b>, <b>cumulative</b> and <b>cnormal</b> sort the data on x and then plot some aspect of the distribution of x values. </p>
<p> The spline and Bezier options determine coefficients describing a continuous curve between the endpoints of the data. This curve is then plotted in the same manner as a function, that is, by finding its value at uniform intervals along the abscissa (see <b><a href="set_show#set_samples">set samples</a></b>) and connecting these points with straight line segments. If the data set is interrupted by blank lines or undefined values a separate continuous curve is fit for each uninterrupted subset of the data. Adjacent separately fit segments may be separated by a gap or discontinuity. </p>
<p> <b>unwrap</b> manipulates the data to avoid jumps of more than pi by adding or subtracting multiples of 2*pi. </p>
<p> If <b>autoscale</b> is in effect, axis ranges will be computed for the final curve rather than for the original data. </p>
<p> If <b>autoscale</b> is not in effect, and a spline curve is being generated, sampling of the spline fit is done across the intersection of the x range covered by the input data and the fixed abscissa range defined by <b>set xrange</b>. </p>
<p> If too few points are available to apply the requested smoothing operation an error message is produced. </p>
<p> The <b>smooth</b> options have no effect on function plots. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION040183610000000000000">Acsplines</h4>  The <b>smooth acsplines</b> option approximates the data with a natural smoothing spline. After the data are made monotonic in x (see <b><a href="plot#smooth_unique">smooth unique</a></b>), a curve is piecewise constructed from segments of cubic polynomials whose coefficients are found by fitting to the individual data points weighted by the value, if any, given in the third column of the using spec. The default is equivalent to  <pre>
plot 'data-file' using 1:2:(1.0) smooth acsplines</pre>  <p> Qualitatively, the absolute magnitude of the weights determines the number of segments used to construct the curve. If the weights are large, the effect of each datum is large and the curve approaches that produced by connecting consecutive points with natural cubic splines. If the weights are small, the curve is composed of fewer segments and thus is smoother; the limiting case is the single segment produced by a weighted linear least squares fit to all the data. The smoothing weight can be expressed in terms of errors as a statistical weight for a point divided by a <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>smoothing factor<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> for the curve so that (standard) errors in the file can be used as smoothing weights. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
sw(x,S)=1/(x*x*S)
plot 'data_file' using 1:2:(sw($3,100)) smooth acsplines</pre>  <h4 id="SECTION040183620000000000000">Bezier</h4>  The <b>smooth bezier</b> option approximates the data with a Bezier curve of degree n (the number of data points) that connects the endpoints. <h4 id="SECTION040183630000000000000">Bins</h4> <b>smooth bins</b> is the same as <b>bins</b>. See <b><a href="plot#bins">bins</a></b>. For related plotting styles see <b><a href="plot#smooth_frequency">smooth frequency</a></b> and <b><a href="plot#smooth_kdensity">smooth kdensity</a></b>. <h4 id="SECTION040183640000000000000">Csplines</h4>  The <b>smooth csplines</b> option connects consecutive points by natural cubic splines after rendering the data monotonic (see <b><a href="plot#smooth_unique">smooth unique</a></b>). <h4 id="SECTION040183650000000000000">Mcsplines</h4>  The <b>smooth mcsplines</b> option connects consecutive points by cubic splines constrained such that the smoothed function preserves the monotonicity and convexity of the original data points. This reduces the effect of outliers. FN Fritsch &amp; RE Carlson (1980) <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 17: 238–246. <h4 id="SECTION040183660000000000000">Sbezier</h4>  The <b>smooth sbezier</b> option first renders the data monotonic (<b>unique</b>) and then applies the <b>bezier</b> algorithm. <h4 id="SECTION040183670000000000000">Unique</h4>  The <b>smooth unique</b> option makes the data monotonic in x; points with the same x-value are replaced by a single point having the average y-value. The resulting points are then connected by straight line segments. <h4 id="SECTION040183680000000000000">Unwrap</h4>  The <b>smooth unwrap</b> option modifies the input data so that any two successive points will not differ by more than pi; a point whose y value is outside this range will be incremented or decremented by multiples of 2pi until it falls within pi of the previous point. This operation is useful for making wrapped phase measurements continuous over time. <h4 id="SECTION040183690000000000000">Frequency</h4>   The <b>smooth frequency</b> option makes the data monotonic in x; points with the same x-value are replaced by a single point having the summed y-values. To plot a histogram of the number of data values in equal size bins, set the y-value to 1.0 so that the sum is a count of occurrences in that bin. This is done implicitly if only a single column is provided. Example:  <pre>
binwidth = &lt;something&gt;  # set width of x values in each bin
bin(val) = binwidth * floor(val/binwidth)
plot "datafile" using (bin(column(1))):(1.0) smooth frequency
plot "datafile" using (bin(column(1))) smooth frequency  # same result</pre>  See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/smooth.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">smooth.dem </span></a> <h4 id="SECTION0401836100000000000000">Fnormal</h4>  The <b>smooth fnormal</b> option work just like the <b>frequency</b> option, but produces a normalized histogram. It makes the data monotonic in x and normalises the y-values so they all sum to 1. Points with the same x-value are replaced by a single point containing the sumed y-values. To plot a histogram of the number of data values in equal size bins, set the y-value to 1.0 so that the sum is a count of occurrences in that bin. This is done implicitly if only a single column is provided. See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/smooth.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">smooth.dem </span></a> <h4 id="SECTION0401836110000000000000">Cumulative</h4>  The <b>smooth cumulative</b> option makes the data monotonic in x; points with the same x-value are replaced by a single point containing the cumulative sum of y-values of all data points with lower x-values (i.e. to the left of the current data point). This can be used to obtain a cumulative distribution function from data. See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/smooth.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">smooth.dem </span></a> <h4 id="SECTION0401836120000000000000">Cnormal</h4>  The <b>smooth cnormal</b> option makes the data monotonic in x and normalises the y-values onto the range [0:1]. Points with the same x-value are replaced by a single point containing the cumulative sum of y-values of all data points with lower x-values (i.e. to the left of the current data point) divided by the total sum of all y-values. This can be used to obtain a normalised cumulative distribution function from data (useful when comparing sets of samples with differing numbers of members). See also <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/smooth.html"><span style="font-family:monospace">smooth.dem </span></a> <h4 id="SECTION0401836130000000000000">Kdensity</h4>  The <b>smooth kdensity</b> option is a way to plot a kernel density estimate (a smooth histogram) for a random collection of points, using Gaussian kernels. A Gaussian is placed at the location of each point in the first column and the sum of all these Gaussians is plotted as a function. The value in the second column is taken as weight of the Gaussian. To obtain a normalized histogram, this should be 1/number-of-points. By default gnuplot calculates and uses the bandwidth which would be optimal for normally distributed data.  <pre>
default_bandwidth = sigma * (4/3N) ** (0.2)</pre>  This will usually be a very conservative, i.e. broad bandwidth. Alternatively, you can provide an explicit bandwidth.  <pre>
plot $DATA smooth kdensity bandwidth &lt;value&gt; with boxes</pre>  The bandwidth used in the previous plot is stored in variable GPVAL_KDENSITY_BANDWIDTH. <h3 id="SECTION040183700000000000000">Special-filenames</h3>    There are a few filenames that have a special meaning: ' ', '-', '+' and '++'. <p> The empty filename ' ' tells gnuplot to re-use the previous input file in the same plot command. So to plot two columns from the same input file: </p>
<pre>
plot 'filename' using 1:2, ” using 1:3</pre>  <p> The filename can also be reused over subsequent plot commands, however <b>save</b> then only records the name in a comment. </p>
<p> The special filenames '+' and '++' are a mechanism to allow the full range of <b>using</b> specifiers and plot styles with inline functions. Normally a function plot can only have a single y (or z) value associated with each sampled point. The pseudo-file '+' treats the sampled points as column 1, and allows additional column values to be specified via a <b>using</b> specification, just as for a true input file. By default samples are generated over the full range as set by <b>set xrange</b>, with the sampling controlled via <b>set samples</b>. </p>
<pre>
plot '+' using ($1):(sin($1)):(sin($1)**2) with filledcurves</pre>  <p> An independent sampling range can be provided immediately before the '+'. As in normal function plots, a name can be assigned to the independent variable. If given for the first plot element, the sampling range specifier has to be preceded by the <b>sample</b> keyword (see also <b><a href="plot#plot_sampling">plot sampling</a></b>). </p>
<pre>
plot sample [beta=0:2*pi] '+' using (sin(beta)):(cos(beta)) with lines</pre>  <p> Additionally, the range specifier of '+' supports giving a sampling increment. </p>
<pre>
plot $MYDATA, [t=-3:25:1] '+' using (t):(f(t))</pre>  <p> The pseudo-file '++' returns 2 columns of data forming a regular grid of [u,v] coordinates with the number of points along u controlled by <b>set samples</b> and the number of points along v controlled by <b>set isosamples</b>. You must set urange and vrange before plotting '++'. However the x and y ranges can be autoscaled or can be explicitly set to different values than urange and vrange. Use of u and v to sample '++' is a CHANGE from version 5.0 Examples: </p>
<pre>
splot '++' using 1:2:(sin($1)*sin($2)) with pm3d
plot '++' using 1:2:(sin($1)*sin($2)) with image</pre>  <p> The special filename <b>'-'</b> specifies that the data are inline; i.e., they follow the command. Only the data follow the command; <b>plot</b> options like filters, titles, and line styles remain on the <b>plot</b> command line. This is similar to <span class="MATH">&lt;</span><span class="MATH">&lt;</span> in unix shell script, and $DECK in VMS DCL. The data are entered as though they are being read from a file, one data point per record. The letter <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>e<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> at the start of the first column terminates data entry. </p>
<p> <b>'-'</b> is intended for situations where it is useful to have data and commands together, e.g. when both are piped to <b>gnuplot</b> from another application. Some of the demos, for example, might use this feature. While <b>plot</b> options such as <b>index</b> and <b>every</b> are recognized, their use forces you to enter data that won't be used. For all but the simplest cases it is probably easier to first define a datablock and then read from it rather than from <b>'-'</b>. See <b><a href="inline_data_datablocks#datablocks">datablocks</a></b>. </p>
<p> If you use <b>'-'</b> with <b>replot</b>, you may need to enter the data more than once. See <b><a href="replot#replot">replot</a></b>, <b><a href="refresh#refresh">refresh</a></b>. Here again it may be better to use a datablock. </p>
<p> A blank filename (' ') specifies that the previous filename should be reused. This can be useful with things like </p>
<pre>
plot 'a/very/long/filename' using 1:2, ” using 1:3, ” using 1:4</pre>  <p> (If you use both <b>'-'</b> and <b>' '</b> on the same <b>plot</b> command, you'll need to have two sets of inline data, as in the example above.) </p>
<h3 id="SECTION040183800000000000000">Piped-data</h3>    On systems with a popen function, the datafile can be piped through a shell command by starting the file name with a '<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>'. For example, <pre>
pop(x) = 103*exp(-x/10)
plot "&lt; awk '{print $1-1965, $2}' population.dat", pop(x)</pre>  <p> would plot the same information as the first population example but with years since 1965 as the x axis.

<p> On systems with an fdopen() function, data can be read from an arbitrary file descriptor attached to either a file or pipe. To read from file descriptor <b>n</b> use <b>'<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>&amp;n'</b>. This allows you to easily pipe in several data files in a single call from a POSIX shell: </p>

plot 'file' using 1:(f($2))</pre>  <h3 id="SECTION0401831000000000000000">Using</h3>  The most common datafile modifier is <b>using</b>. It tells the program which columns of data in the input file are to be plotted. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
plot 'file' using &lt;entry&gt; {:&lt;entry&gt; {:&lt;entry&gt; ...}} {'format'}</pre>  <p> If a format is specified, it is used to read in each datafile record using the C library 'scanf' function. Otherwise the record is interpreted as consisting of columns (fields) of data separated by whitespace (spaces and/or tabs), but see <b><a href="set_show#datafile_separator">datafile separator</a></b>. </p>
<p> Each <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>entry<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> may be a simple column number that selects the value from one field of the input file, a string that matches a column label in the first line of a data set, an expression enclosed in parentheses, or a special function not enclosed in parentheses such as xticlabels(2). </p>
<p> If the entry is an expression in parentheses, then the function column(N) may be used to indicate the value in column N. That is, column(1) refers to the first item read, column(2) to the second, and so on. The special symbols $1, $2, ... are shorthand for column(1), column(2) ... The function <b>valid(N)</b> tests whether the value in the Nth column is a valid number.   If each column of data in the input file contains a label in the first row rather than a data value, this label can be used to identify the column on input and/or in the plot legend. The column() function can be used to select an input column by label rather than by column number. For example, if the data file contains  </p>
<pre>
Height    Weight    Age
val1      val1      val1
...       ...       ...</pre>  then the following plot commands are all equivalent  <pre>
plot 'datafile' using 3:1, ” using 3:2
plot 'datafile' using (column("Age")):(column(1)), \
             ” using (column("Age")):(column(2))
plot 'datafile' using "Age":"Height", ” using "Age":"Weight"</pre>  <p> The full string must match. Comparison is case-sensitive. To use column labels in the plot legend, use <b>set key autotitle columnhead</b>. </p>
<p> In addition to the actual columns 1...N in the input data file, gnuplot presents data from several <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pseudo-columns<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> that hold bookkeeping information. E.g. $0 or column(0) returns the sequence number of this data record within a dataset. Please see <b><a href="plot#pseudocolumns">pseudocolumns</a></b>. </p>
<p> An empty <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>entry<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will default to its order in the list of entries. For example, <b>using ::4</b> is interpreted as <b>using 1:2:4</b>. </p>
<p> If the <b>using</b> list has only a single entry, that <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>entry<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> will be used for y and the data point number (pseudo-column $0) is used for x; for example, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>plot 'file' using 1</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is identical to <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span><b>plot 'file' using 0:1</b><span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>. If the <b>using</b> list has two entries, these will be used for x and y. See <b><a href="set_show#set_style">set style</a></b> and <b><a href="fit#fit">fit</a></b> for details about plotting styles that make use of data from additional columns of input. </p>
<p> 'scanf' accepts several numerical specifications but <b>gnuplot</b> requires all inputs to be double-precision floating-point variables, so <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>%lf<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> is essentially the only permissible specifier. A format string given by the user must contain at least one such input specifier, and no more than seven of them. 'scanf' expects to see white space — a blank, tab (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>t<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), newline (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>n<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>), or formfeed (<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>f<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>) — between numbers; anything else in the input stream must be explicitly skipped. </p>
<p> Note that the use of <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>t<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>n<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>, or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> <span class="MATH">\</span>f<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> requires use of double-quotes rather than single-quotes. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION0401831010000000000000">Using_examples</h4> This creates a plot of the sum of the 2nd and 3rd data against the first: The format string specifies comma- rather than space-separated columns. The same result could be achieved by specifying <b>set datafile separator comma</b>.  <pre>
plot 'file' using 1:($2+$3) '%lf,%lf,%lf'</pre>  <p> In this example the data are read from the file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>MyData<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> using a more complicated format:  </p>
<pre>
plot 'MyData' using "%*lf%lf%*20[^\n]%lf"</pre>  <p> The meaning of this format is: </p>
<pre>
%*lf        ignore a number
%lf         read a double-precision number (x by default)
%*20[^\n]   ignore 20 non-newline characters
%lf         read a double-precision number (y by default)</pre>  <p>   One trick is to use the ternary <b>?:</b> operator to filter data: </p>
<pre>
plot 'file' using 1:($3&gt;10 ? $2 : 1/0)</pre>  <p> which plots the datum in column two against that in column one provided the datum in column three exceeds ten. <b>1/0</b> is undefined; <b>gnuplot</b> quietly ignores undefined points, so unsuitable points are suppressed. Or you can use the pre-defined variable NaN to achieve the same result. </p>
<p> In fact, you can use a constant expression for the column number, provided it doesn't start with an opening parenthesis; constructs like <b>using 0+(complicated expression)</b> can be used. The crucial point is that the expression is evaluated once if it doesn't start with a left parenthesis, or once for each data point read if it does. </p>
<p> If timeseries data are being used, the time can span multiple columns. The starting column should be specified. Note that the spaces within the time must be included when calculating starting columns for other data. E.g., if the first element on a line is a time with an embedded space, the y value should be specified as column three. </p>
<p> It should be noted that (a) <b>plot 'file'</b>, (b) <b>plot 'file' using 1:2</b>, and (c) <b>plot 'file' using ($1):($2)</b> can be subtly different. The exact behaviour has changed in version 5. See <b><a href="set_show#missing">missing</a></b>. </p>
<p> It is often possible to plot a file with lots of lines of garbage at the top simply by specifying </p>
<pre>
plot 'file' using 1:2</pre>  <p> However, if you want to leave text in your data files, it is safer to put the comment character (#) in the first column of the text lines. </p>
<h4 id="SECTION0401831020000000000000">Pseudocolumns</h4>  Expressions in the <b>using</b> clause of a plot statement can refer to additional bookkeeping values in addition to the actual data values contained in the input file. These are contained in <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>pseudocolumns<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>.  <pre>
column(0)   The sequential order of each point within a data set.
            The counter starts at 0 and is reset by two sequential blank
            records.  The shorthand form $0 is available.
column(-1)  This counter starts at 0 and is reset by a single blank line.
            This corresponds to the data line in array or grid data.
column(-2)  The index number of the current data set within a file that
            contains multiple data sets.  See `index`.</pre>  <h4 id="SECTION0401831030000000000000">Xticlabels</h4>  Axis tick labels can be generated via a string function, usually taking a data column as an argument. The simplest form uses the data column itself as a string. That is, xticlabels(N) is shorthand for xticlabels(stringcolumn(N)). This example uses the contents of column 3 as x-axis tick labels. <pre>
plot 'datafile' using &lt;xcol&gt;:&lt;ycol&gt;:xticlabels(3) with &lt;plotstyle&gt;</pre>  <p> Axis tick labels may be generated for any of the plot axes: x x2 y y2 z. The <b>ticlabels(<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>labelcol<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>)</b> specifiers must come after all of the data coordinate specifiers in the <b>using</b> portion of the command. For each data point which has a valid set of X,Y[,Z] coordinates, the string value given to xticlabels() is added to the list of xtic labels at the same X coordinate as the point it belongs to. <b>xticlabels()</b> may be shortened to <b>xtic()</b> and so on. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<pre>
splot "data" using 2:4:6:xtic(1):ytic(3):ztic(6)</pre>  <p> In this example the x and y axis tic labels are taken from different columns than the x and y coordinate values. The z axis tics, however, are generated from the z coordinate of the corresponding point. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<pre>
plot "data" using 1:2:xtic( $3 &gt; 10. ? "A" : "B" )</pre>  <p> This example shows the use of a string-valued function to generate x-axis tick labels. Each point in the data file generates a tick mark on x labeled either <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>A<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> or <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>B<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> depending on the value in column 3. </p>

<p> The y error bar is a vertical line plotted from (x, ylow) to (x, yhigh). If ydelta is specified instead of ylow and yhigh, ylow = y - ydelta and yhigh = y + ydelta are derived. If there are only two numbers on the record, yhigh and ylow are both set to y. The x error bar is a horizontal line computed in the same fashion. To get lines plotted between the data points, <b>plot</b> the data file twice, once with errorbars and once with lines (but remember to use the <b>notitle</b> option on one to avoid two entries in the key). Alternately, use the errorlines command (see <b><a href="plot#errorlines">errorlines</a></b>). </p>

<p> The use of on-the-fly range specifiers in a plot command may not yield the expected result for linked axes (see <b><a href="set_show#set_link">set link</a></b>). It is better to use separate set xrange and set yrange statements instead. </p>

plot for [dataset in "apples bananas"] dataset."dat" title dataset</pre>  <p> In this example iteration is used both to generate a file name and a corresponding title. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
file(n) = sprintf("dataset_%d.dat",n)
splot for [i=1:10] file(i) title sprintf("dataset %d",i)</pre>  <p> This example defines a string-valued function that generates file names, and plots ten such files together. The iteration variable ('i' in this example) is treated as an integer, and may be used more than once. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
set key left
plot for [n=1:4] x**n sprintf("%d",n)</pre>  <p> This example plots a family of functions. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
list = "apple banana cabbage daikon eggplant"
item(n) = word(list,n)
plot for [i=1:words(list)] item[i].".dat" title item(i)
list = "new stuff"
replot</pre>  <p> This example steps through a list and plots once per item. Because the items are retrieved dynamically, you can change the list and then replot. </p>
<p> Example:  </p>
<pre>
list = "apple banana cabbage daikon eggplant"
plot for [i in list] i.".dat" title i
list = "new stuff"
replot</pre>  <p> This example does exactly the same thing as the previous example, but uses the string iterator form of the command rather than an integer iterator. </p>
<p> If an iteration is to continue until all available data is consumed, use the symbol * instead of an integer <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>end<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>. This can be used to process all columns in a line, all datasets (separated by 2 blank lines) in a file, or all files matching a template. </p>
<p> Examples:  </p>
<pre>
plot for [i=2:*] 'datafile' using 1:i with histogram
splot for [i=0:*] 'datafile' index i using 1:2:3 with lines 
plot for [i=1:*] file=sprintf("File_%03d.dat",i) file using 2 title file</pre>  <h2 id="SECTION0401811000000000000000">Title</h2>  By default each plot is listed in the key by the corresponding function or file name. You can give an explicit plot title instead using the <b>title</b> option. <p> Syntax:  </p>
<pre>
title &lt;text&gt; | notitle [&lt;ignored text&gt;]
title columnheader | title columnheader(N)
      {at {beginning|end}} {{no}enhanced}</pre>  <p> where <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>text<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a quoted string or an expression that evaluates to a string. The quotes will not be shown in the key. </p>
<p> There is also an option that will interpret the first entry in a column of input data (i.e. the column header) as a text field, and use it as the key title. See <b><a href="datastrings#datastrings">datastrings</a></b>. This can be made the default by specifying <b>set key autotitle columnhead</b>. </p>
<p> The line title and sample can be omitted from the key by using the keyword <b>notitle</b>. A null title (<b>title ' '</b>) is equivalent to <b>notitle</b>. If only the sample is wanted, use one or more blanks (<b>title ' '</b>). If <b>notitle</b> is followed by a string this string is ignored. </p>
<p> If <b>key autotitles</b> is set (which is the default) and neither <b>title</b> nor <b>notitle</b> are specified the line title is the function name or the file name as it appears on the <b>plot</b> command. If it is a file name, any datafile modifiers specified will be included in the default title. </p>
<p> The layout of the key itself (position, title justification, etc.) can be controlled by <b>set key</b>. Please see <b><a href="set_show#set_key">set key</a></b> for details. </p>
<p> The <b>at</b> keyword allows you to place the plot title somewhere outside the auto-generated key box. The title can be placed immediately before or after the line in the graph itself by using <b>at {beginning<span class="MATH">|</span>end}</b>. This option may be useful when plotting <b>with lines</b> but makes little sense for most other styles. </p>
<p> To place the plot title at an arbitrary location on the page, use the form <b>at <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>x-position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>,<span class="MATH">&lt;</span>y-position<span class="MATH">&gt;</span></b>. By default the position is interpreted in screen coordinates; e.g. <b>at 0.5, 0.5</b> is always the middle of the screen regardless of plot axis scales or borders. The format of titles placed in this way is still affected by key options. See <b><a href="set_show#set_key">set key</a></b>. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> This plots y=x with the title 'x':  </p>
<pre>
plot x</pre>  <p> This plots x squared with title <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>x<code>^</code>2<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> and file <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>data.1<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span> with title <span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>measured data<span style="font-family:monospace">"</span>:  </p>
<pre>
plot x**2 title "x^2", 'data.1' t "measured data"</pre>  <p> Plot multiple columns of data, each of which contains its own title on the first line of the file. Place the titles after the corresponding lines rather than in a separate key:  </p>

See <b><a href="set_show#fillstyle">fillstyle</a></b>. Some styles have further sub-styles. See <b>plotting styles</b> for details of each. The <b>table</b> style produces tabular output rather than a plot. See <b><a href="set_show#set_table">set table</a></b>. </p>
<p> A default style may be chosen by <b>set style function</b> and <b>set style data</b>. </p>
<p> By default, each function and data file will use a different line type and point type, up to the maximum number of available types. All terminal drivers support at least six different point types, and re-use them, in order, if more are required. To see the complete set of line and point types available for the current terminal, type <b><a href="test#test">test</a></b>. </p>
<p> If you wish to choose the line or point type for a single plot, <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line_type<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>point_type<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> may be specified. These are positive integer constants (or expressions) that specify the line type and point type to be used for the plot. Use <b>test</b> to display the types available for your terminal. </p>
<p> You may also scale the line width and point size for a plot by using <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line_width<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> and <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>point_size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span>, which are specified relative to the default values for each terminal. The pointsize may also be altered globally — see <b><a href="set_show#set_pointsize">set pointsize</a></b> for details. But note that both <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>point_size<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> as set here and as set by <b>set pointsize</b> multiply the default point size — their effects are not cumulative. That is, <b>set pointsize 2; plot x w p ps 3</b> will use points three times default size, not six. </p>
<p> It is also possible to specify <b>pointsize variable</b> either as part of a line style or for an individual plot. In this case one extra column of input is required, i.e. 3 columns for a 2D plot and 4 columns for a 3D splot. The size of each individual point is determined by multiplying the global pointsize by the value read from the data file. </p>
<p> If you have defined specific line type/width and point type/size combinations with <b>set style line</b>, one of these may be selected by setting <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>line_style<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> to the index of the desired style. </p>
<p> If gnuplot was built with <b>pm3d</b> support, the special keyword <b>palette</b> is allowed for smooth color change of lines, points and dots in <b>splot</b>. The color is chosen from a smooth palette which was set previously with the command <b>set palette</b>. The color value corresponds to the z-value of the point coordinates or to the color coordinate if specified by the 4th parameter in <b>using</b>. Both 2D and 3D plots (<b>plot</b> and <b>splot</b> commands) can use palette colors as specified by either their fractional value or the corresponding value mapped to the colorbox range. A palette color value can also be read from an explicitly specified input column in the <b>using</b> specifier. See <b><a href="linetypes_colors_styles#colors">colors</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show#set_palette">set palette</a></b>, <b><a href="set_show#linetype">linetype</a></b>. </p>
<p> The keyword <b>nohidden3d</b> applies only to plots made with the <b>splot</b> command. Normally the global option <b>set hidden3d</b> applies to all plots in the graph. You can attach the <b>nohidden3d</b> option to any individual plots that you want to exclude from the hidden3d processing. The individual elements other than surfaces (i.e. lines, dots, labels, ...) of a plot marked <b>nohidden3d</b> will all be drawn, even if they would normally be obscured by other plot elements. </p>
<p> Similarly, the keyword <b>nocontours</b> will turn off contouring for an individual plot even if the global property <b>set contour</b> is active. </p>
<p> Similarly, the keyword <b>nosurface</b> will turn off the 3D surface for an individual plot even if the global property <b>set surface</b> is active. </p>
<p> The keywords may be abbreviated as indicated. </p>
<p> Note that the <b>linewidth</b>, <b>pointsize</b> and <b>palette</b> options are not supported by all terminals. </p>
