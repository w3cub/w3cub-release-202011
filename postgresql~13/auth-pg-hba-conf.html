<h1>20.1. The <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> File</h1>    <p>Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file, which traditionally is named <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> and is stored in the database cluster's data directory. (HBA stands for host-based authentication.) A default <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is installed when the data directory is initialized by <code class="command">initdb</code>. It is possible to place the authentication configuration file elsewhere, however; see the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-file-locations#GUC-HBA-FILE">hba_file</a> configuration parameter.</p> <p>The general format of the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any text after the <code class="literal">#</code> comment character. Records cannot be continued across lines. A record is made up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs. Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted. Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g., <code class="literal">all</code> or <code class="literal">replication</code>) makes the word lose its special meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.</p> <p>Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name, and the authentication method to be used for connections matching these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type, client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform authentication. There is no <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fall-through</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">backup</span>”</span>: if one record is chosen and the authentication fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches, access is denied.</p> <p>A record can have several formats:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
local         database  user  auth-method [auth-options]
host          database  user  address     auth-method  [auth-options]

hostnossl     database  user  address     auth-method  [auth-options]
hostgssenc    database  user  address     auth-method  [auth-options]
hostnogssenc  database  user  address     auth-method  [auth-options]

The value <code class="literal">all</code> specifies that it matches all databases. The value <code class="literal">sameuser</code> specifies that the record matches if the requested database has the same name as the requested user. The value <code class="literal">samerole</code> specifies that the requested user must be a member of the role with the same name as the requested database. (<code class="literal">samegroup</code> is an obsolete but still accepted spelling of <code class="literal">samerole</code>.) Superusers are not considered to be members of a role for the purposes of <code class="literal">samerole</code> unless they are explicitly members of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of being a superuser. The value <code class="literal">replication</code> specifies that the record matches if a physical replication connection is requested (note that replication connections do not specify any particular database). Otherwise, this is the name of a specific PostgreSQL database. Multiple database names can be supplied by separating them with commas. A separate file containing database names can be specified by preceding the file name with <code class="literal">@</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code>user</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies which database user name(s) this record matches. The value <code class="literal">all</code> specifies that it matches all users. Otherwise, this is either the name of a specific database user, or a group name preceded by <code class="literal">+</code>. (Recall that there is no real distinction between users and groups in PostgreSQL; a <code class="literal">+</code> mark really means <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">match any of the roles that are directly or indirectly members of this role</span>”</span>, while a name without a <code class="literal">+</code> mark matches only that specific role.) For this purpose, a superuser is only considered to be a member of a role if they are explicitly a member of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of being a superuser. Multiple user names can be supplied by separating them with commas. A separate file containing user names can be specified by preceding the file name with <code class="literal">@</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code>address</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches. This field can contain either a host name, an IP address range, or one of the special key words mentioned below.</p> <p>An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation for the range's starting address, then a slash (<code class="literal">/</code>) and a CIDR mask length. The mask length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client IP address that must match. Bits to the right of this should be zero in the given IP address. There must not be any white space between the IP address, the <code class="literal">/</code>, and the CIDR mask length.</p> <p>Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are <code class="literal">172.20.143.89/32</code> for a single host, or <code class="literal">172.20.143.0/24</code> for a small network, or <code class="literal">10.6.0.0/16</code> for a larger one. An IPv6 address range might look like <code class="literal">::1/128</code> for a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or <code class="literal">fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</code> for a small network. <code class="literal">0.0.0.0/0</code> represents all IPv4 addresses, and <code class="literal">::0/0</code> represents all IPv6 addresses. To specify a single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6. In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.</p> <p>An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections, and an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections, even if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range. Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's C library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.</p> <p>You can also write <code class="literal">all</code> to match any IP address, <code class="literal">samehost</code> to match any of the server's own IP addresses, or <code class="literal">samenet</code> to match any address in any subnet that the server is directly connected to.</p> <p>If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address range or a special key word is treated as a host name), that name is compared with the result of a reverse name resolution of the client's IP address (e.g., reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons are case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether any of the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client's IP address. If both directions match, then the entry is considered to match. (The host name that is used in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> should be the one that address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns, otherwise the line won't be matched. Some host name databases allow associating an IP address with multiple host names, but the operating system will only return one host name when asked to resolve an IP address.)</p> <p>A host name specification that starts with a dot (<code class="literal">.</code>) matches a suffix of the actual host name. So <code class="literal">.example.com</code> would match <code class="literal">foo.example.com</code> (but not just <code class="literal">example.com</code>).</p> <p>When host names are specified in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>, you should make sure that name resolution is reasonably fast. It can be of advantage to set up a local name resolution cache such as <code class="command">nscd</code>. Also, you may wish to enable the configuration parameter <code class="varname">log_hostname</code> to see the client's host name instead of the IP address in the log.</p> <p>These fields do not apply to <code class="literal">local</code> records.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>Users sometimes wonder why host names are handled in this seemingly complicated way, with two name resolutions including a reverse lookup of the client's IP address. This complicates use of the feature in case the client's reverse DNS entry is not set up or yields some undesirable host name. It is done primarily for efficiency: this way, a connection attempt requires at most two resolver lookups, one reverse and one forward. If there is a resolver problem with some address, it becomes only that client's problem. A hypothetical alternative implementation that only did forward lookups would have to resolve every host name mentioned in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> during every connection attempt. That could be quite slow if many names are listed. And if there is a resolver problem with one of the host names, it becomes everyone's problem.</p> <p>Also, a reverse lookup is necessary to implement the suffix matching feature, because the actual client host name needs to be known in order to match it against the pattern.</p> <p>Note that this behavior is consistent with other popular implementations of host name-based access control, such as the Apache HTTP Server and TCP Wrappers.</p> </blockquote> </dd> <dt>
<code>IP-address</code><code>IP-mask</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>These two fields can be used as an alternative to the <code>IP-address</code><code class="literal">/</code><code>mask-length</code> notation. Instead of specifying the mask length, the actual mask is specified in a separate column. For example, <code class="literal">255.0.0.0</code> represents an IPv4 CIDR mask length of 8, and <code class="literal">255.255.255.255</code> represents a CIDR mask length of 32.</p> <p>These fields do not apply to <code class="literal">local</code> records.</p> </dd> <dt><code>auth-method</code></dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the authentication method to use when a connection matches this record.

Details about which options are available for which authentication methods appear below.</p> <p>In addition to the method-specific options listed below, there is one method-independent authentication option <code class="literal">clientcert</code>, which can be specified in any <code class="literal">hostssl</code> record. This option can be set to <code class="literal">verify-ca</code> or <code class="literal">verify-full</code>. Both options require the client to present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate, while <code class="literal">verify-full</code> additionally enforces that the <code class="literal">cn</code> (Common Name) in the certificate matches the username or an applicable mapping. This behavior is similar to the <code class="literal">cert</code> authentication method (see <a class="xref" href="auth-cert" title="20.12. Certificate Authentication">Section 20.12</a>) but enables pairing the verification of client certificates with any authentication method that supports <code class="literal">hostssl</code> entries.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Files included by <code class="literal">@</code> constructs are read as lists of names, which can be separated by either whitespace or commas.

Unless the file name following <code class="literal">@</code> is an absolute path, it is taken to be relative to the directory containing the referencing file.</p> <p>Since the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> records are examined sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication methods. For example, one might wish to use <code class="literal">trust</code> authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying <code class="literal">trust</code> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider range of allowed client IP addresses.</p> <p id="id-1.6.7.8.9.3">The <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is read on start-up and when the main server process receives a <span class="systemitem">SIGHUP</span> signal.
