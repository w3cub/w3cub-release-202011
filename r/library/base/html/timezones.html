<h2>
<code>timezones</code> Time Zones</h2> <h3>Description</h3> <p>Information about time zones in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. <code>Sys.timezone</code> returns the name of the current time zone. </p> <h3>Usage</h3> <pre data-language="r">
Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)

OlsonNames(tzdir = NULL)
</pre> <h3>Arguments</h3> <table summary="R argblock"> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>location</code></td> <td> <p>logical: defunct: ignored, with a warning for false values.</p> </td>
</tr> <tr valign="top">
<td><code>tzdir</code></td> <td> <p>The time-zone database to be used: the default is to try known locations until one is found.</p> </td>
</tr> </table> <h3>Details</h3> <p>Time zones are a system-specific topic, but these days almost all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> platforms use similar underlying code, used by Linux, macOS, Solaris, AIX and FreeBSD, and installed with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> on Windows. (Unfortunately there are many system-specific errors in the implementations.) It is possible to use the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> sources' version of the code on Unix-alikes as well as on Windows: this is the default for macOS and recommended for Solaris. </p> <p>It should be possible to set the current time zone via the environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span>: see the section on ‘Time zone names’ for suitable values. <code>Sys.timezone()</code> will return the value of <span class="env">TZ</span> if set initially (and on some OSes it is always set), otherwise it will try to retrieve from the OS a value which if set for <span class="env">TZ</span> would give the initial time zone. (‘Initially’ means before any time-zone functions are used: if <span class="env">TZ</span> is being set to override the OS setting or if the ‘try’ does not get this right, it should be set before the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> process is started or (probably early enough) in file <code><a href="startup">.Rprofile</a></code>). </p> <p>If <span class="env">TZ</span> is set but invalid, most platforms default to <span class="samp">UTC</span>, the time zone colloquially known as <span class="samp">GMT</span> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time</a>). (Some but not all platforms will give a warning for invalid values.) If it is unset or empty the <em>system</em> time zone is used (the one returned by <code>Sys.timezone</code>). </p> <p>Time zones did not come into use until the middle of the nineteenth century and were not widely adopted until the twentieth, and <em>daylight saving time</em> (DST, also known as <em>summer time</em>) was first introduced in the early twentieth century, most widely in 1916. Over the last 100 years places have changed their affiliation between major time zones, have opted out of (or in to) DST in various years or adopted DST rule changes late or not at all. (The UK experimented with DST throughout 1971, only.) In a few countries (one is the Irish Republic) it is the summer time which is the ‘standard’ time and a different name is used in winter. And there can be multiple changes during a year, for example for Ramadan. </p> <p>A quite common system implementation of <code>POSIXct</code> is as signed 32-bit integers and so only goes back to the end of 1901: on such systems <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> assumes that dates prior to that are in the same time zone as they were in 1902. Most of the world had not adopted time zones by 1902 (so used local ‘mean time’ based on longitude) but for a few places there had been time-zone changes before then. 64-bit representations are becoming common; unfortunately on some 64-bit OSes the database information is 32-bit and so only available for the range 1901–2038, and incompletely for the end years. </p> <p>As from <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.5.0, when a time zone location is first found in a session, its value is cached in object <code>.sys.timezone</code> in the base environment. </p> <h3>Value</h3> <p><code>Sys.timezone</code> returns an OS-specific character string, possibly <code>NA</code> or an empty string (which on some OSes means <span class="samp">UTC</span>). This will be a location such as <code>"Europe/London"</code> if one can be ascertained. </p> <p>A time zone region may be known by several names: for example <span class="samp">"Europe/London"</span> is also known as <span class="samp">GB</span>, <span class="samp">GB-Eire</span>, <span class="samp">Europe/Belfast</span>, <span class="samp">Europe/Guernsey</span>, <span class="samp">Europe/Isle_of_Man</span> and <span class="samp">Europe/Jersey</span>. A few regions are also known by a summary of their time zone, e.g. <span class="samp">PST8PDT</span> is an alias for <span class="samp">America/Los_Angeles</span>. </p> <p><code>OlsonNames</code> returns a character vector, see the examples for typical cases. It may have an attribute <code>"Version"</code>, something like <span class="samp">"2020a"</span>. </p> <h3>Time zone names</h3> <p>Names <code>"UTC"</code> and its synonym <code>"GMT"</code> are accepted on all platforms. </p> <p>Where OSes describe their valid time zones can be obscure. The help for the C function <code>tzset</code> can be helpful, but it can also be inaccurate. There is a cumbersome POSIX specification (listed under environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span> at <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08</a>), which is often at least partially supported, but there are other more user-friendly ways to specify time zones. </p> <p>Almost all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> platforms make use of a time-zone database originally compiled by Arthur David Olson and now managed by IANA, in which the preferred way to refer to a time zone is by a location (typically of a city), e.g., <code>Europe/London</code>, <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>, <code>Pacific/Easter</code> within a ‘time zone region’. Some traditional designations are also allowed such as <code>EST5EDT</code> or <code>GB</code>. (Beware that some of these designations may not be what you expect: in particular <code>EST</code> is a time zone used in Canada <em>without</em> daylight saving time, and not <code>EST5EDT</code> nor (Australian) Eastern Standard Time.) The designation can also be an optional colon prepended to the path to a file giving complied zone information (and the examples above are all files in a system-specific location). See <a href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html">https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html</a> for more details and references. By convention, regions with a unique time-zone history since 1970 have specific names in the database, but those with different earlier histories may not. Each time zone has one or two (the second for DST) <em>abbreviations</em> used when formatting times. </p> <p>The abbreviations used have changed over the years: for example France used <span class="samp">PMT</span> (‘Paris Mean Time’) from 1891 to 1911 then <span class="samp">WET/WEST</span> up to 1940 and <span class="samp">CET/CEST</span> from 1946. (In almost all time zones the abbreviations have been stable since 1970.) The POSIX standard allows only one or two abbreviations per time zone, so you may see the current abbreviation(s) used for older times. </p> <p>For some time zones abbreviations are like <span class="samp">-03</span> and <span class="samp">+0845</span>: this is done when there is no official abbreviation. (Negative values are behind (West of) UTC, as for the <code>"%z"</code> format for <code><a href="strptime">strftime</a></code>.) </p> <p>The function <code>OlsonNames</code> returns the time-zone names known to the currently selected Olson/IANA database. The system-specific location in the file system varies, e.g. ‘<span class="file">/usr/share/zoneinfo</span>’ (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD), ‘<span class="file">/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo</span>’ (Solaris, AIX), .... It is likely that there is a file named something like ‘<span class="file">zone1970.tab</span>’ or (older) ‘<span class="file">zone.tab</span>’ under that directory listing the locations known as time-zone names (but not for example <code>EST5EDT</code>). See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab</a>. </p> <p>Where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was configured with option <span class="option">--with-internal-tzcode</span> (the default on Windows: recommended on Solaris), the database at <code>file.path(R.home("share"), "zoneinfo")</code> is used by default: file ‘<span class="file">VERSION</span>’ in that directory states the version. That option is also the default on macOS but there whichever is more recent of the system database at ‘<span class="file">/var/db/timezone/zoneinfo</span>’ and that distributed with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is used by default. Environment variable <span class="env">TZDIR</span> can be used to point to a different ‘<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>’ database: value <code>"internal"</code> indicates the database from the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> sources and <code>"macOS"</code> indicates the system database. (Setting either of those values would not be recognized by other software using <span class="env">TZDIR</span>.) </p> <p>Setting <span class="env">TZDIR</span> is also supported by the native services on some OSes, e.g. Linux using <code>glibc</code> except in secure modes. </p> <p>Time zones given by name (<em>via</em> environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span>, in <code>tz</code> arguments to functions such as <code><a href="as.posixlt">as.POSIXlt</a></code> and perhaps the system time zone) are loaded from the currently selected ‘<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>’ database. </p> <p>Most platforms support time zones of the form <span class="samp">Etc/GMT+n</span> and <span class="samp">Etc/GMT-n</span> (possibly also without prefix <span class="samp">Etc/</span>), which assume a fixed offset from UTC (hence no DST). Contrary to some expectations (but consistent with names such as <span class="samp">PST8PDT</span>), negative offsets are times ahead of (east of) UTC, positive offsets are times behind (west of) UTC. </p> <p>Immediately prior to the advent of legislated time zones, most people used time based on their longitude (or that of a nearby town), known as ‘Local Mean Time’ and abbreviated as <span class="samp">LMT</span> in the databases: in many countries that was codified with a specific name before the switch to a standard time. For example, Paris codified its LMT as ‘Paris Mean Time’ in 1891 (to be used throughout mainland France) and switched to <span class="samp">GMT+0</span> in 1911. </p> <p>Some systems (notably Linux) have a <code>tzselect</code> command which allows the interactive selection of a supported time zone name. On systems using <code>systemd</code> (notably Linux), the OS command <code>timedatectl list-timezones</code> will list all available time zone names. </p> <h3>Warning</h3> <p>There is a system-specific upper limit on the number of bytes in (abbreviated) time-zone names which can be as low as 6 (as required by POSIX). Some OSes allow the setting of time zones with names which exceed their limit, and that can crash the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session. </p> <p><code>OlsonNames</code> tries to find an Olson database in known locations. It might not succeed (when it returns an empty vector with a warning) and even if it does it might not locate the database used by the date-time code linked into <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. Fortunately names are added rarely and most databases are pretty complete. </p> <h3>How the system time zone is found</h3> <p>This section is of background interest for users of a Unix-alike, but may help if an <code>NA</code> value is returned unexpectedly. </p> <p>Commercial Unixen such as Solaris and AIX set <span class="env">TZ</span>, so the value when <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is started is used. </p> <p>All other common platforms (Linux, macOS, *BSD) use similar schemes, either derived from <code>tzcode</code> (currently distributed from <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">https://www.iana.org/time-zones</a>) or independently coded (<code>glibc</code>, <code>musl-libc</code>). Such systems read the time-zone information from a file ‘<span class="file">localtime</span>’, usually under ‘<span class="file">/etc</span>’ (but possibly under ‘<span class="file">/usr/local/etc</span>’ or ‘<span class="file">/usr/local/etc/zoneinfo</span>’). As the usual Linux manual page for <code>localtime</code> says </p> <p>‘Because the time zone identifier is extracted from the symlink target name of ‘<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>’, this file may not be a normal file or hardlink.’ </p> <p>Nevertheless, some Linux distributions (including the one from which that quote was taken) or sysadmins have chosen to copy a time-zone file to ‘<span class="file">localtime</span>’. For a non-symlink, the ultimate fallback is to compare that file to all files in the time-zone database. </p> <p>Some Linux platforms provide two other mechanisms which are tried in turn before looking at ‘<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>’. </p> <ul> <li> <p>‘Modern’ Linux systems use <code>systemd</code> which provides mechanisms to set and retrieve the time zone (amongst other things). There is a command <code>timedatectl</code> to give details. (Unfortunately RHEL/Centos 6.x are not ‘modern’.) </p> </li> <li>
<p> Debian-derived systems since <em>ca</em> 2007 have supplied a file ‘<span class="file">/etc/timezone</span>’. Its format is undocumented but empirically it contains a single line of text naming the time zone. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>In each case a sanity check is performed that the time-zone name is the name of a file in the time-zone database. (The systems probably use the time-zone file (symlinked to) ‘<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>’, but the <code>Sys.timezone</code> code does not check that is the same as the named file in the database. This is deliberate as they may be from different dates.) </p> <h3>Note</h3> <p>Since 2007 there has been considerable disruption over changes to the timings of the DST transitions, originally aimed at energy conservation. These often have short notice and time-zone databases may not be up to date. (Morocco in 2013 announced a change to the end of DST at <em>a days</em> notice, and in 2015 North Korea gave imprecise information about a change a week in advance.) </p> <p>On platforms with case-insensitive file systems, time zone names will be case-insensitive. They may or may not be on other platforms and so, for example, <code>"gmt"</code> is valid on some platforms and not on others. </p> <p>Note that except where replaced, the operation of time zones is an OS service, and even where replaced a third-party database is used and can be updated (see the section on ‘Time zone names’). Incorrect results will never be an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> issue, so please ensure that you have the courtesy not to blame <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> for them. </p> <h3>See Also</h3> <p><code><a href="sys.time">Sys.time</a></code>, <code><a href="as.posixlt">as.POSIXlt</a></code>. </p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone</a> and <a href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html">https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html</a> for extensive sets of links. </p> <p><a href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html">https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html</a> for the ‘rules’ of the Olson/IANA database. </p> <h3>Examples</h3> <pre data-language="r">
