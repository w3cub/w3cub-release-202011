</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION"> <h2>Description</h2> <p>The <code class="command">GRANT</code> command has two basic variants: one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure, procedural language, large object, configuration parameter, schema, tablespace, or type), and one that grants membership in a role. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be described separately.</p> <div class="refsect2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-OBJECTS"> <h3>GRANT on Database Objects</h3> <p>This variant of the <code class="command">GRANT</code> command gives specific privileges on a database object to one or more roles. These privileges are added to those already granted, if any.</p> <p>The key word <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> indicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might be created later. <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> can be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all roles. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.</p> <p>If <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.</p> <p>If <code class="literal">GRANTED BY</code> is specified, the specified grantor must be the current user. This clause is currently present in this form only for SQL compatibility.</p> <p>There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety.)</p> <p>The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. (However, a similar effect can be obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns the object; see below.) The owner implicitly has all grant options for the object, too.</p> <p>The possible privileges are:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt>
<code class="literal">SELECT</code><code class="literal">INSERT</code><code class="literal">UPDATE</code><code class="literal">DELETE</code><code class="literal">TRUNCATE</code><code class="literal">REFERENCES</code><code class="literal">TRIGGER</code><code class="literal">CREATE</code><code class="literal">CONNECT</code><code class="literal">TEMPORARY</code><code class="literal">EXECUTE</code><code class="literal">USAGE</code><code class="literal">SET</code><code class="literal">ALTER SYSTEM</code>
</dt> <dd> <p>Specific types of privileges, as defined in <a class="xref" href="ddl-priv" title="5.7. Privileges">Section 5.7</a>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">TEMP</code></dt> <dd> <p>Alternative spelling for <code class="literal">TEMPORARY</code>.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">ALL PRIVILEGES</code></dt> <dd> <p>Grant all of the privileges available for the object's type. The <code class="literal">PRIVILEGES</code> key word is optional in PostgreSQL, though it is required by strict SQL.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>The <code class="literal">FUNCTION</code> syntax works for plain functions, aggregate functions, and window functions, but not for procedures; use <code class="literal">PROCEDURE</code> for those. Alternatively, use <code class="literal">ROUTINE</code> to refer to a function, aggregate function, window function, or procedure regardless of its precise type.</p> <p>There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas. This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, functions, and procedures. <code class="literal">ALL TABLES</code> also affects views and foreign tables, just like the specific-object <code class="command">GRANT</code> command. <code class="literal">ALL FUNCTIONS</code> also affects aggregate and window functions, but not procedures, again just like the specific-object <code class="command">GRANT</code> command. Use <code class="literal">ALL ROUTINES</code> to include procedures.</p> </div> <div class="refsect2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-ROLES"> <h3>GRANT on Roles</h3> <p>This variant of the <code class="command">GRANT</code> command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles. Membership in a role is significant because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its members.</p> <p>If <code class="literal">WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> is specified, the member can in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that. A role is not considered to hold <code class="literal">WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> on itself. Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role to anyone. Roles having <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> privilege can grant or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser.</p> <p>If <code class="literal">GRANTED BY</code> is specified, the grant is recorded as having been done by the specified role. Only database superusers may use this option, except when it names the same role executing the command.</p> <p>Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>. Note also that this form of the command does not allow the noise word <code class="literal">GROUP</code> in <code>role_specification</code>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-NOTES"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>The <a class="link" href="sql-revoke" title="REVOKE"><code class="command">REVOKE</code></a> command is used to revoke access privileges.</p> <p>Since PostgreSQL 8.1, the concepts of users and groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role. It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword <code class="literal">GROUP</code> to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group. <code class="literal">GROUP</code> is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.</p> <p>A user may perform <code class="command">SELECT</code>, <code class="command">INSERT</code>, etc. on a column if they hold that privilege for either the specific column or its whole table. Granting the privilege at the table level and then revoking it for one column will not do what one might wish: the table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.</p> <p>When a non-owner of an object attempts to <code class="command">GRANT</code> privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The <code class="command">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES</code> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)</p> <p>It should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege settings. This is comparable to the rights of <code class="literal">root</code> in a Unix system. As with <code class="literal">root</code>, it's unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>If a superuser chooses to issue a <code class="command">GRANT</code> or <code class="command">REVOKE</code> command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted by the containing role itself.)</p> <p><code class="command">GRANT</code> and <code class="command">REVOKE</code> can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> on the object. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code>. For example, if table <code class="literal">t1</code> is owned by role <code class="literal">g1</code>, of which role <code class="literal">u1</code> is a member, then <code class="literal">u1</code> can grant privileges on <code class="literal">t1</code> to <code class="literal">u2</code>, but those privileges will appear to have been granted directly by <code class="literal">g1</code>. Any other member of role <code class="literal">g1</code> could revoke them later.</p> <p>If the role executing <code class="command">GRANT</code> holds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant. In such cases it is best practice to use <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> to become the specific role you want to do the <code class="command">GRANT</code> as.</p> <p>Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend permissions to any sequences used by the table, including sequences tied to <code class="type">SERIAL</code> columns. Permissions on sequences must be set separately.</p> <p>See <a class="xref" href="ddl-priv" title="5.7. Privileges">Section 5.7</a> for more information about specific privilege types, as well as how to inspect objects' privileges.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-EXAMPLES"> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>Grant insert privilege to all users on table <code class="literal">films</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
GRANT INSERT ON films TO PUBLIC;
</pre> <p>Grant all available privileges to user <code class="literal">manuel</code> on view <code class="literal">kinds</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds TO manuel;
</pre> <p>Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a superuser or the owner of <code class="literal">kinds</code>, when executed by someone else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has grant options.</p> <p>Grant membership in role <code class="literal">admins</code> to user <code class="literal">joe</code>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
GRANT admins TO joe;
</pre> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-COMPATIBILITY"> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>According to the SQL standard, the <code class="literal">PRIVILEGES</code> key word in <code class="literal">ALL PRIVILEGES</code> is required. The SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than one object per command.</p> <p>PostgreSQL allows an object owner to revoke their own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table read-only to themselves by revoking their own <code class="literal">INSERT</code>, <code class="literal">UPDATE</code>, <code class="literal">DELETE</code>, and <code class="literal">TRUNCATE</code> privileges. This is not possible according to the SQL standard. The reason is that PostgreSQL treats the owner's privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they can revoke them too. In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are granted by an assumed entity <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">_SYSTEM</span>”</span>. Not being <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">_SYSTEM</span>”</span>, the owner cannot revoke these rights.</p> <p>According to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>; PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options to roles.</p> <p>The SQL standard allows the <code class="literal">GRANTED BY</code> option to specify only <code class="literal">CURRENT_USER</code> or <code class="literal">CURRENT_ROLE</code>. The other variants are PostgreSQL extensions.</p> <p>The SQL standard provides for a <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations, translations.</p> <p>In the SQL standard, sequences only have a <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege, which controls the use of the <code class="literal">NEXT VALUE FOR</code> expression, which is equivalent to the function <code class="function">nextval</code> in PostgreSQL. The sequence privileges <code class="literal">SELECT</code> and <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> are PostgreSQL extensions. The application of the sequence <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege to the <code class="literal">currval</code> function is also a PostgreSQL extension (as is the function itself).</p> <p>Privileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, languages, and configuration parameters are PostgreSQL extensions.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.150.9"> <h2>See Also</h2>
