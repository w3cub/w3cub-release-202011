<h1 id="an-overview-of-chef">An Overview of Chef</h1> <p>Welcome to Chef!</p> <p>Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Whether you’re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.</p> <p>This diagram shows how you develop, test, and deploy your Chef code.</p> <img src="https://docs-archive.chef.io/release/12-13/_images/start_chef.svg" width="700px">   <h2 id="chef-components">Chef Components</h2> <p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of Chef, including the nodes, the server, premium features of the server, and the workstation. These elements work together to provide the chef-client the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job. As you are reviewing the rest of this topic, use the icons in the tables to refer back to this image.</p> <img src="https://docs-archive.chef.io/release/12-13/_images/chef_overview.svg" width="600px">  <p>Chef has the following major components:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="20%"> <col width="80%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">

Most recipes are simple patterns (blocks that define properties and values that map to specific configuration items like packages, files, services, templates, and users). The full power of Ruby is available for when you need a programming language.</p> <p class="last">Often, a workstation is configured to use the Chef development kit as the development toolkit. The Chef development kit is a package from Chef that provides an optional (but recommended) set of tooling, including Chef itself, the chef command line tool, Kitchen, ChefSpec, Berkshelf, and more.</p> </td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">

Therefore, Chef makes as few decisions on its own as possible. When a decision must be made, the chef-client uses a reasonable default setting that can be easily changed. While Chef encourages the use of the tooling packaged in the Chef development kit, none of these tools should be seen as a requirement or pre-requisite for being successful using Chef.</p>  <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3> <p>Some important components of workstations include:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="19%"> <col width="81%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">

The Recipe DSL also helps ensure that recipes interact with nodes (and node properties) in the desired manner.

Compliance can be many things. For example, ensuring that file and directory management meets specific internal IT policies—”Does the file exist?”, “Do the correct users or groups have access to this directory?”. Compliance may also be complex, such as helping to ensure goals defined by large-scale compliance frameworks such as PCI, HIPAA, and Sarbanes-Oxley can be met.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>   <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system, plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of the Ruby language. Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well as being able to handle any customization path your organization requires.</p>
