When EOF is received on standard input, fast import writes out updated branch and tag refs, fully updating the current repository with the newly imported data.</p>   <p>The fast-import backend itself can import into an empty repository (one that has already been initialized by <code>git init</code>) or incrementally update an existing populated repository. Whether or not incremental imports are supported from a particular foreign source depends on the frontend program in use.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt---force"> --force </dt> <dd> <p>Force updating modified existing branches, even if doing so would cause commits to be lost (as the new commit does not contain the old commit).</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt---quiet"> --quiet </dt> <dd> <p>Disable the output shown by --stats, making fast-import usually be silent when it is successful.

Assuming the frontend is able to keep up with fast-import and feed it a constant stream of data, import times for projects holding 10+ years of history and containing 100,000+ individual commits are generally completed in just 1-2 hours on quite modest (~$2,000 USD) hardware.</p>   <p>Most bottlenecks appear to be in foreign source data access (the source just cannot extract revisions fast enough) or disk IO (fast-import writes as fast as the disk will take the data). Imports will run faster if the source data is stored on a different drive than the destination Git repository (due to less IO contention).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_development_cost">Development cost</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>A typical frontend for fast-import tends to weigh in at approximately 200 lines of Perl/Python/Ruby code. Most developers have been able to create working importers in just a couple of hours, even though it is their first exposure to fast-import, and sometimes even to Git. This is an ideal situation, given that most conversion tools are throw-away (use once, and never look back).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_parallel_operation">Parallel operation</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Like <code>git push</code> or <code>git fetch</code>, imports handled by fast-import are safe to run alongside parallel <code>git repack -a -d</code> or <code>git gc</code> invocations, or any other Git operation (including <code>git prune</code>, as loose objects are never used by fast-import).</p>   <p>fast-import does not lock the branch or tag refs it is actively importing. After the import, during its ref update phase, fast-import tests each existing branch ref to verify the update will be a fast-forward update (the commit stored in the ref is contained in the new history of the commit to be written). If the update is not a fast-forward update, fast-import will skip updating that ref and instead prints a warning message. fast-import will always attempt to update all branch refs, and does not stop on the first failure.</p>   <p>Branch updates can be forced with --force, but it’s recommended that this only be used on an otherwise quiet repository. Using --force is not necessary for an initial import into an empty repository.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_technical_discussion">Technical discussion</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>fast-import tracks a set of branches in memory. Any branch can be created or modified at any point during the import process by sending a <code>commit</code> command on the input stream. This design allows a frontend program to process an unlimited number of branches simultaneously, generating commits in the order they are available from the source data. It also simplifies the frontend programs considerably.</p>   <p>fast-import does not use or alter the current working directory, or any file within it. (It does however update the current Git repository, as referenced by <code>GIT_DIR</code>.) Therefore an import frontend may use the working directory for its own purposes, such as extracting file revisions from the foreign source. This ignorance of the working directory also allows fast-import to run very quickly, as it does not need to perform any costly file update operations when switching between branches.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_input_format">Input format</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>With the exception of raw file data (which Git does not interpret) the fast-import input format is text (ASCII) based. This text based format simplifies development and debugging of frontend programs, especially when a higher level language such as Perl, Python or Ruby is being used.</p>   <p>fast-import is very strict about its input. Where we say SP below we mean <strong>exactly</strong> one space. Likewise LF means one (and only one) linefeed and HT one (and only one) horizontal tab. Supplying additional whitespace characters will cause unexpected results, such as branch names or file names with leading or trailing spaces in their name, or early termination of fast-import when it encounters unexpected input.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_stream_comments">
Stream Comments</h3>  <p>To aid in debugging frontends fast-import ignores any line that begins with <code>#</code> (ASCII pound/hash) up to and including the line ending <code>LF</code>. A comment line may contain any sequence of bytes that does not contain an LF and therefore may be used to include any detailed debugging information that might be specific to the frontend and useful when inspecting a fast-import data stream.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_date_formats">
Date Formats</h3>  <p>The following date formats are supported. A frontend should select the format it will use for this import by passing the format name in the --date-format=&lt;fmt&gt; command-line option.</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt-coderawcode"> <code>raw</code> </dt> <dd> <p>This is the Git native format and is <code>&lt;time&gt; SP &lt;offutc&gt;</code>. It is also fast-import’s default format, if --date-format was not specified.</p>  <p>The time of the event is specified by <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> as the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight, Jan 1, 1970, UTC) and is written as an ASCII decimal integer.</p>   <p>The local offset is specified by <code>&lt;offutc&gt;</code> as a positive or negative offset from UTC. For example EST (which is 5 hours behind UTC) would be expressed in <code>&lt;tz&gt;</code> by “-0500” while UTC is “+0000”. The local offset does not affect <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>; it is used only as an advisement to help formatting routines display the timestamp.</p>   <p>If the local offset is not available in the source material, use “+0000”, or the most common local offset. For example many organizations have a CVS repository which has only ever been accessed by users who are located in the same location and time zone. In this case a reasonable offset from UTC could be assumed.</p>   <p>Unlike the <code>rfc2822</code> format, this format is very strict. Any variation in formatting will cause fast-import to reject the value, and some sanity checks on the numeric values may also be performed.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt-coderaw-permissivecode"> <code>raw-permissive</code> </dt> <dd> <p>This is the same as <code>raw</code> except that no sanity checks on the numeric epoch and local offset are performed. This can be useful when trying to filter or import an existing history with e.g. bogus timezone values.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt-coderfc2822code"> <code>rfc2822</code> </dt> <dd> <p>This is the standard email format as described by RFC 2822.</p>  <p>An example value is “Tue Feb 6 11:22:18 2007 -0500”. The Git parser is accurate, but a little on the lenient side. It is the same parser used by <code>git am</code> when applying patches received from email.</p>   <p>Some malformed strings may be accepted as valid dates. In some of these cases Git will still be able to obtain the correct date from the malformed string. There are also some types of malformed strings which Git will parse wrong, and yet consider valid. Seriously malformed strings will be rejected.</p>   <p>Unlike the <code>raw</code> format above, the time zone/UTC offset information contained in an RFC 2822 date string is used to adjust the date value to UTC prior to storage. Therefore it is important that this information be as accurate as possible.</p>   <p>If the source material uses RFC 2822 style dates, the frontend should let fast-import handle the parsing and conversion (rather than attempting to do it itself) as the Git parser has been well tested in the wild.</p>   <p>Frontends should prefer the <code>raw</code> format if the source material already uses UNIX-epoch format, can be coaxed to give dates in that format, or its format is easily convertible to it, as there is no ambiguity in parsing.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fast-import.txt-codenowcode"> <code>now</code> </dt> <dd> <p>Always use the current time and time zone. The literal <code>now</code> must always be supplied for <code>&lt;when&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>This is a toy format. The current time and time zone of this system is always copied into the identity string at the time it is being created by fast-import. There is no way to specify a different time or time zone.</p>   <p>This particular format is supplied as it’s short to implement and may be useful to a process that wants to create a new commit right now, without needing to use a working directory or <code>git update-index</code>.</p>   <p>If separate <code>author</code> and <code>committer</code> commands are used in a <code>commit</code> the timestamps may not match, as the system clock will be polled twice (once for each command). The only way to ensure that both author and committer identity information has the same timestamp is to omit <code>author</code> (thus copying from <code>committer</code>) or to use a date format other than <code>now</code>.</p>  </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_commands">

It is very common for frontends to mark every commit they create, thereby allowing future branch creation from any imported commit.</p>   <p>The <code>data</code> command following <code>committer</code> must supply the commit message (see below for <code>data</code> command syntax). To import an empty commit message use a 0 length data. Commit messages are free-form and are not interpreted by Git. Currently they must be encoded in UTF-8, as fast-import does not permit other encodings to be specified.</p>   <p>Zero or more <code>filemodify</code>, <code>filedelete</code>, <code>filecopy</code>, <code>filerename</code>, <code>filedeleteall</code> and <code>notemodify</code> commands may be included to update the contents of the branch prior to creating the commit. These commands may be supplied in any order. However it is recommended that a <code>filedeleteall</code> command precede all <code>filemodify</code>, <code>filecopy</code>, <code>filerename</code> and <code>notemodify</code> commands in the same commit, as <code>filedeleteall</code> wipes the branch clean (see below).</p>   <p>The <code>LF</code> after the command is optional (it used to be required). Note that for reasons of backward compatibility, if the commit ends with a <code>data</code> command (i.e. it has no <code>from</code>, <code>merge</code>, <code>filemodify</code>, <code>filedelete</code>, <code>filecopy</code>, <code>filerename</code>, <code>filedeleteall</code> or <code>notemodify</code> commands) then two <code>LF</code> commands may appear at the end of the command instead of just one.</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_author">
<code>author</code>
</h4>  <p>An <code>author</code> command may optionally appear, if the author information might differ from the committer information. If <code>author</code> is omitted then fast-import will automatically use the committer’s information for the author portion of the commit. See below for a description of the fields in <code>author</code>, as they are identical to <code>committer</code>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_committer">
<code>committer</code>
</h4>  <p>The <code>committer</code> command indicates who made this commit, and when they made it.</p>   <p>Here <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the person’s display name (for example “Com M Itter”) and <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> is the person’s email address (“cm@example.com”). <code>LT</code> and <code>GT</code> are the literal less-than (\x3c) and greater-than (\x3e) symbols. These are required to delimit the email address from the other fields in the line. Note that <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> are free-form and may contain any sequence of bytes, except <code>LT</code>, <code>GT</code> and <code>LF</code>. <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is typically UTF-8 encoded.</p>   <p>The time of the change is specified by <code>&lt;when&gt;</code> using the date format that was selected by the --date-format=&lt;fmt&gt; command-line option. See “Date Formats” above for the set of supported formats, and their syntax.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_encoding">
<code>encoding</code>
</h4>  <p>The optional <code>encoding</code> command indicates the encoding of the commit message. Most commits are UTF-8 and the encoding is omitted, but this allows importing commit messages into git without first reencoding them.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_from">
<code>from</code>
</h4>  <p>The <code>from</code> command is used to specify the commit to initialize this branch from. This revision will be the first ancestor of the new commit. The state of the tree built at this commit will begin with the state at the <code>from</code> commit, and be altered by the content modifications in this commit.</p>   <p>Omitting the <code>from</code> command in the first commit of a new branch will cause fast-import to create that commit with no ancestor. This tends to be desired only for the initial commit of a project. If the frontend creates all files from scratch when making a new branch, a <code>merge</code> command may be used instead of <code>from</code> to start the commit with an empty tree. Omitting the <code>from</code> command on existing branches is usually desired, as the current commit on that branch is automatically assumed to be the first ancestor of the new commit.</p>   <p>As <code>LF</code> is not valid in a Git refname or SHA-1 expression, no quoting or escaping syntax is supported within <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code>.</p>   <p>Here <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> is any of the following:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The name of an existing branch already in fast-import’s internal branch table. If fast-import doesn’t know the name, it’s treated as a SHA-1 expression.</p> </li> <li> <p>A mark reference, <code>:&lt;idnum&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;idnum&gt;</code> is the mark number.</p>  <p>The reason fast-import uses <code>:</code> to denote a mark reference is this character is not legal in a Git branch name. The leading <code>:</code> makes it easy to distinguish between the mark 42 (<code>:42</code>) and the branch 42 (<code>42</code> or <code>refs/heads/42</code>), or an abbreviated SHA-1 which happened to consist only of base-10 digits.</p>   <p>Marks must be declared (via <code>mark</code>) before they can be used.</p>  </li> <li> <p>A complete 40 byte or abbreviated commit SHA-1 in hex.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any valid Git SHA-1 expression that resolves to a commit. See “SPECIFYING REVISIONS” in <a href="gitrevisions">gitrevisions[7]</a> for details.</p> </li> <li> <p>The special null SHA-1 (40 zeros) specifies that the branch is to be removed.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>The special case of restarting an incremental import from the current branch value should be written as:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        from refs/heads/branch^0</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The <code>^0</code> suffix is necessary as fast-import does not permit a branch to start from itself, and the branch is created in memory before the <code>from</code> command is even read from the input. Adding <code>^0</code> will force fast-import to resolve the commit through Git’s revision parsing library, rather than its internal branch table, thereby loading in the existing value of the branch.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_merge">
<code>merge</code>
</h4>  <p>Includes one additional ancestor commit. The additional ancestry link does not change the way the tree state is built at this commit. If the <code>from</code> command is omitted when creating a new branch, the first <code>merge</code> commit will be the first ancestor of the current commit, and the branch will start out with no files. An unlimited number of <code>merge</code> commands per commit are permitted by fast-import, thereby establishing an n-way merge.</p>   <p>Here <code>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</code> is any of the commit specification expressions also accepted by <code>from</code> (see above).</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_filemodify">

<code>filedelete</code>
</h4>  <p>Included in a <code>commit</code> command to remove a file or recursively delete an entire directory from the branch.

Once the source location has been renamed to the destination any future commands applied to the source location will create new files there and not impact the destination of the rename.</p>   <p>Note that a <code>filerename</code> is the same as a <code>filecopy</code> followed by a <code>filedelete</code> of the source location. There is a slight performance advantage to using <code>filerename</code>, but the advantage is so small that it is never worth trying to convert a delete/add pair in source material into a rename for fast-import.

<code>filedeleteall</code>
</h4>  <p>Included in a <code>commit</code> command to remove all files (and also all directories) from the branch.

The <code>filedeleteall</code> approach may however require fast-import to use slightly more memory per active branch (less than 1 MiB for even most large projects); so frontends that can easily obtain only the affected paths for a commit are encouraged to do so.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_notemodify">

Trying to include your own PGP/GPG signature is not recommended, as the frontend does not (easily) have access to the complete set of bytes which normally goes into such a signature.

<code>reset</code>
</h3>  <p>Creates (or recreates) the named branch, optionally starting from a specific revision.

Most fast-import commands have no visible effect until the next checkpoint (or completion). The frontend can send commands to fill fast-import’s input pipe without worrying about how quickly they will take effect, which improves performance by simplifying scheduling.</p>   <p>For some frontends, though, it is useful to be able to read back data from the current repository as it is being updated (for example when the source material describes objects in terms of patches to be applied to previously imported objects). This can be accomplished by connecting the frontend and fast-import via bidirectional pipes:</p>  <div class="exampleblock"> <div class="content"> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>mkfifo fast-import-output
frontend &lt;fast-import-output |
git fast-import &gt;fast-import-output</pre> </div> </div> </div> </div>  <p>A frontend set up this way can use <code>progress</code>, <code>get-mark</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cat-blob</code> commands to read information from the import in progress.</p>   <p>To avoid deadlock, such frontends must completely consume any pending output from <code>progress</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>get-mark</code>, and <code>cat-blob</code> before performing writes to fast-import that might block.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_crash_reports">Crash reports</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>If fast-import is supplied invalid input it will terminate with a non-zero exit status and create a crash report in the top level of the Git repository it was importing into.

This exclusion saves space within the report file and reduces the amount of buffering that fast-import must perform during execution.</p>   <p>After writing a crash report fast-import will close the current packfile and export the marks table. This allows the frontend developer to inspect the repository state and resume the import from the point where it crashed. The modified branches and tags are not updated during a crash, as the import did not complete successfully. Branch and tag information can be found in the crash report and must be applied manually if the update is needed.</p>   <p>An example crash:</p>  <div class="exampleblock"> <div class="content"> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat &gt;in &lt;&lt;END_OF_INPUT

END OF CRASH REPORT</pre> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_tips_and_tricks">Tips and tricks</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The following tips and tricks have been collected from various users of fast-import, and are offered here as suggestions.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_use_one_mark_per_commit">
Use One Mark Per Commit</h3>  <p>When doing a repository conversion, use a unique mark per commit (<code>mark :&lt;n&gt;</code>) and supply the --export-marks option on the command line. fast-import will dump a file which lists every mark and the Git object SHA-1 that corresponds to it. If the frontend can tie the marks back to the source repository, it is easy to verify the accuracy and completeness of the import by comparing each Git commit to the corresponding source revision.</p>   <p>Coming from a system such as Perforce or Subversion this should be quite simple, as the fast-import mark can also be the Perforce changeset number or the Subversion revision number.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_freely_skip_around_branches">
Freely Skip Around Branches</h3>  <p>Don’t bother trying to optimize the frontend to stick to one branch at a time during an import. Although doing so might be slightly faster for fast-import, it tends to increase the complexity of the frontend code considerably.</p>   <p>The branch LRU builtin to fast-import tends to behave very well, and the cost of activating an inactive branch is so low that bouncing around between branches has virtually no impact on import performance.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_handling_renames">
Handling Renames</h3>  <p>When importing a renamed file or directory, simply delete the old name(s) and modify the new name(s) during the corresponding commit. Git performs rename detection after-the-fact, rather than explicitly during a commit.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_use_tag_fixup_branches">
Use Tag Fixup Branches</h3>  <p>Some other SCM systems let the user create a tag from multiple files which are not from the same commit/changeset. Or to create tags which are a subset of the files available in the repository.</p>   <p>Importing these tags as-is in Git is impossible without making at least one commit which “fixes up” the files to match the content of the tag. Use fast-import’s <code>reset</code> command to reset a dummy branch outside of your normal branch space to the base commit for the tag, then commit one or more file fixup commits, and finally tag the dummy branch.</p>   <p>For example since all normal branches are stored under <code>refs/heads/</code> name the tag fixup branch <code>TAG_FIXUP</code>. This way it is impossible for the fixup branch used by the importer to have namespace conflicts with real branches imported from the source (the name <code>TAG_FIXUP</code> is not <code>refs/heads/TAG_FIXUP</code>).</p>   <p>When committing fixups, consider using <code>merge</code> to connect the commit(s) which are supplying file revisions to the fixup branch. Doing so will allow tools such as <code>git blame</code> to track through the real commit history and properly annotate the source files.</p>   <p>After fast-import terminates the frontend will need to do <code>rm .git/TAG_FIXUP</code> to remove the dummy branch.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_import_now_repack_later">
Import Now, Repack Later</h3>  <p>As soon as fast-import completes the Git repository is completely valid and ready for use. Typically this takes only a very short time, even for considerably large projects (100,000+ commits).</p>   <p>However repacking the repository is necessary to improve data locality and access performance. It can also take hours on extremely large projects (especially if -f and a large --window parameter is used). Since repacking is safe to run alongside readers and writers, run the repack in the background and let it finish when it finishes. There is no reason to wait to explore your new Git project!</p>   <p>If you choose to wait for the repack, don’t try to run benchmarks or performance tests until repacking is completed. fast-import outputs suboptimal packfiles that are simply never seen in real use situations.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_repacking_historical_data">
Repacking Historical Data</h3>  <p>If you are repacking very old imported data (e.g. older than the last year), consider expending some extra CPU time and supplying --window=50 (or higher) when you run <code>git repack</code>. This will take longer, but will also produce a smaller packfile. You only need to expend the effort once, and everyone using your project will benefit from the smaller repository.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_include_some_progress_messages">
Include Some Progress Messages</h3>  <p>Every once in a while have your frontend emit a <code>progress</code> message to fast-import. The contents of the messages are entirely free-form, so one suggestion would be to output the current month and year each time the current commit date moves into the next month. Your users will feel better knowing how much of the data stream has been processed.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="_packfile_optimization">Packfile optimization</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>When packing a blob fast-import always attempts to deltify against the last blob written. Unless specifically arranged for by the frontend, this will probably not be a prior version of the same file, so the generated delta will not be the smallest possible. The resulting packfile will be compressed, but will not be optimal.</p>   <p>Frontends which have efficient access to all revisions of a single file (for example reading an RCS/CVS ,v file) can choose to supply all revisions of that file as a sequence of consecutive <code>blob</code> commands. This allows fast-import to deltify the different file revisions against each other, saving space in the final packfile. Marks can be used to later identify individual file revisions during a sequence of <code>commit</code> commands.</p>   <p>The packfile(s) created by fast-import do not encourage good disk access patterns. This is caused by fast-import writing the data in the order it is received on standard input, while Git typically organizes data within packfiles to make the most recent (current tip) data appear before historical data. Git also clusters commits together, speeding up revision traversal through better cache locality.</p>   <p>For this reason it is strongly recommended that users repack the repository with <code>git repack -a -d</code> after fast-import completes, allowing Git to reorganize the packfiles for faster data access. If blob deltas are suboptimal (see above) then also adding the <code>-f</code> option to force recomputation of all deltas can significantly reduce the final packfile size (30-50% smaller can be quite typical).</p>   <p>Instead of running <code>git repack</code> you can also run <code>git gc
--aggressive</code>, which will also optimize other things after an import (e.g. pack loose refs). As noted in the "AGGRESSIVE" section in <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a> the <code>--aggressive</code> option will find new deltas with the <code>-f</code> option to <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a>. For the reasons elaborated on above using <code>--aggressive</code> after a fast-import is one of the few cases where it’s known to be worthwhile.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_memory_utilization">Memory utilization</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>There are a number of factors which affect how much memory fast-import requires to perform an import. Like critical sections of core Git, fast-import uses its own memory allocators to amortize any overheads associated with malloc. In practice fast-import tends to amortize any malloc overheads to 0, due to its use of large block allocations.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_object">
per object</h3>  <p>fast-import maintains an in-memory structure for every object written in this execution. On a 32 bit system the structure is 32 bytes, on a 64 bit system the structure is 40 bytes (due to the larger pointer sizes). Objects in the table are not deallocated until fast-import terminates. Importing 2 million objects on a 32 bit system will require approximately 64 MiB of memory.</p>   <p>The object table is actually a hashtable keyed on the object name (the unique SHA-1). This storage configuration allows fast-import to reuse an existing or already written object and avoid writing duplicates to the output packfile. Duplicate blobs are surprisingly common in an import, typically due to branch merges in the source.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_mark">
per mark</h3>  <p>Marks are stored in a sparse array, using 1 pointer (4 bytes or 8 bytes, depending on pointer size) per mark. Although the array is sparse, frontends are still strongly encouraged to use marks between 1 and n, where n is the total number of marks required for this import.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_branch">
per branch</h3>  <p>Branches are classified as active and inactive. The memory usage of the two classes is significantly different.</p>   <p>Inactive branches are stored in a structure which uses 96 or 120 bytes (32 bit or 64 bit systems, respectively), plus the length of the branch name (typically under 200 bytes), per branch. fast-import will easily handle as many as 10,000 inactive branches in under 2 MiB of memory.</p>   <p>Active branches have the same overhead as inactive branches, but also contain copies of every tree that has been recently modified on that branch. If subtree <code>include</code> has not been modified since the branch became active, its contents will not be loaded into memory, but if subtree <code>src</code> has been modified by a commit since the branch became active, then its contents will be loaded in memory.</p>   <p>As active branches store metadata about the files contained on that branch, their in-memory storage size can grow to a considerable size (see below).</p>   <p>fast-import automatically moves active branches to inactive status based on a simple least-recently-used algorithm. The LRU chain is updated on each <code>commit</code> command. The maximum number of active branches can be increased or decreased on the command line with --active-branches=.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_active_tree">
per active tree</h3>  <p>Trees (aka directories) use just 12 bytes of memory on top of the memory required for their entries (see “per active file” below). The cost of a tree is virtually 0, as its overhead amortizes out over the individual file entries.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_active_file_entry">
per active file entry</h3>  <p>Files (and pointers to subtrees) within active trees require 52 or 64 bytes (32/64 bit platforms) per entry. To conserve space, file and tree names are pooled in a common string table, allowing the filename “Makefile” to use just 16 bytes (after including the string header overhead) no matter how many times it occurs within the project.</p>   <p>The active branch LRU, when coupled with the filename string pool and lazy loading of subtrees, allows fast-import to efficiently import projects with 2,000+ branches and 45,114+ files in a very limited memory footprint (less than 2.7 MiB per active branch).</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="_signals">Signals</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Sending <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> to the <code>git fast-import</code> process ends the current packfile early, simulating a <code>checkpoint</code> command. The impatient operator can use this facility to peek at the objects and refs from an import in progress, at the cost of some added running time and worse compression.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_see_also">See also</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p><a href="git-fast-export">git-fast-export[1]</a></p>  </div>
