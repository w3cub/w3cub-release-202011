Type 0 is invalid.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_size_encoding">
Size encoding</h3>  <p>This document uses the following "size encoding" of non-negative integers: From each byte, the seven least significant bits are used to form the resulting integer. As long as the most significant bit is 1, this process continues; the byte with MSB 0 provides the last seven bits. The seven-bit chunks are concatenated. Later values are more significant.</p>   <p>This size encoding should not be confused with the "offset encoding", which is also used in this document.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_deltified_representation">
Deltified representation</h3>  <p>Conceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree, tag and blob. However to save space, an object could be stored as a "delta" of another "base" object. These representations are assigned new types ofs-delta and ref-delta, which is only valid in a pack file.</p>   <p>Both ofs-delta and ref-delta store the "delta" to be applied to another object (called <code>base object</code>) to reconstruct the object. The difference between them is, ref-delta directly encodes base object name. If the base object is in the same pack, ofs-delta encodes the offset of the base object in the pack instead.</p>   <p>The base object could also be deltified if it’s in the same pack. Ref-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack (i.e. the so-called "thin pack"). When stored on disk however, the pack should be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.</p>   <p>The delta data starts with the size of the base object and the size of the object to be reconstructed. These sizes are encoded using the size encoding from above. The remainder of the delta data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct the object from the base object. If the base object is deltified, it must be converted to canonical form first. Each instruction appends more and more data to the target object until it’s complete. There are two supported instructions so far: one for copy a byte range from the source object and one for inserting new data embedded in the instruction itself.</p>   <p>Each instruction has variable length. Instruction type is determined by the seventh bit of the first octet. The following diagrams follow the convention in RFC 1951 (Deflate compressed data format).</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_instruction_to_copy_from_base_object">
Instruction to copy from base object</h4> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+-------+
| 1xxxxxxx | offset1 | offset2 | offset3 | offset4 | size1 | size2 | size3 |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+-------+</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is the instruction format to copy a byte range from the source object. It encodes the offset to copy from and the number of bytes to copy. Offset and size are in little-endian order.</p>   <p>All offset and size bytes are optional. This is to reduce the instruction size when encoding small offsets or sizes. The first seven bits in the first octet determines which of the next seven octets is present. If bit zero is set, offset1 is present. If bit one is set offset2 is present and so on.</p>   <p>Note that a more compact instruction does not change offset and size encoding. For example, if only offset2 is omitted like below, offset3 still contains bits 16-23. It does not become offset2 and contains bits 8-15 even if it’s right next to offset1.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>+----------+---------+---------+

Each bit needs to correspond to an object in the MIDX, and so we need an efficient mapping from bit position to MIDX position.</p>   <p>One solution is to let bits occupy the same position in the oid-sorted index stored by the MIDX. But because oids are effectively random, their resulting reachability bitmaps would have no locality, and thus compress poorly. (This is the reason that single-pack bitmaps use the pack ordering, and not the .idx ordering, for the same purpose.)</p>   <p>So we’d like to define an ordering for the whole MIDX based around pack ordering, which has far better locality (and thus compresses more efficiently). We can think of a pseudo-pack created by the concatenation of all of the packs in the MIDX. E.g., if we had a MIDX with three packs (a, b, c), with 10, 15, and 20 objects respectively, we can imagine an ordering of the objects like:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where the ordering of the packs is defined by the MIDX’s pack list, and then the ordering of objects within each pack is the same as the order in the actual packfile.</p>   <p>Given the list of packs and their counts of objects, you can naïvely reconstruct that pseudo-pack ordering (e.g., the object at position 27 must be (c,1) because packs "a" and "b" consumed 25 of the slots). But there’s a catch. Objects may be duplicated between packs, in which case the MIDX only stores one pointer to the object (and thus we’d want only one slot in the bitmap).</p>   <p>Callers could handle duplicates themselves by reading objects in order of their bit-position, but that’s linear in the number of objects, and much too expensive for ordinary bitmap lookups. Building a reverse index solves this, since it is the logical inverse of the index, and that index has already removed duplicates. But, building a reverse index on the fly can be expensive. Since we already have an on-disk format for pack-based reverse indexes, let’s reuse it for the MIDX’s pseudo-pack, too.</p>   <p>Objects from the MIDX are ordered as follows to string together the pseudo-pack. Let <code>pack(o)</code> return the pack from which <code>o</code> was selected by the MIDX, and define an ordering of packs based on their numeric ID (as stored by the MIDX). Let <code>offset(o)</code> return the object offset of <code>o</code> within <code>pack(o)</code>. Then, compare <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code> as follows:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>If one of <code>pack(o1)</code> and <code>pack(o2)</code> is preferred and the other is not, then the preferred one sorts first.</p>  <p>(This is a detail that allows the MIDX bitmap to determine which pack should be used by the pack-reuse mechanism, since it can ask the MIDX for the pack containing the object at bit position 0).</p>  </li> <li> <p>If <code>pack(o1) ≠ pack(o2)</code>, then sort the two objects in descending order based on the pack ID.</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise, <code>pack(o1) = pack(o2)</code>, and the objects are sorted in pack-order (i.e., <code>o1</code> sorts ahead of <code>o2</code> exactly when <code>offset(o1)
&lt; offset(o2)</code>).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>In short, a MIDX’s pseudo-pack is the de-duplicated concatenation of objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid out in pack order, and the packs arranged in MIDX order (with the preferred pack coming first).</p>   <p>The MIDX’s reverse index is stored in the optional <code>RIDX</code> chunk within the MIDX itself.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_cruft_packs">Cruft packs</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The cruft packs feature offer an alternative to Git’s traditional mechanism of removing unreachable objects. This document provides an overview of Git’s pruning mechanism, and how a cruft pack can be used instead to accomplish the same.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_background">
Background</h3>  <p>To remove unreachable objects from your repository, Git offers <code>git repack -Ad</code> (see <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a>). Quoting from the documentation:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[...] unreachable objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
instead of being left in the old pack. [...] loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next 'git gc' invocation.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Unreachable objects aren’t removed immediately, since doing so could race with an incoming push which may reference an object which is about to be deleted. Instead, those unreachable objects are stored as loose objects and stay that way until they are older than the expiration window, at which point they are removed by <a href="git-prune">git-prune[1]</a>.</p>   <p>Git must store these unreachable objects loose in order to keep track of their per-object mtimes. If these unreachable objects were written into one big pack, then either freshening that pack (because an object contained within it was re-written) or creating a new pack of unreachable objects would cause the pack’s mtime to get updated, and the objects within it would never leave the expiration window. Instead, objects are stored loose in order to keep track of the individual object mtimes and avoid a situation where all cruft objects are freshened at once.</p>   <p>This can lead to undesirable situations when a repository contains many unreachable objects which have not yet left the grace period. Having large directories in the shards of <code>.git/objects</code> can lead to decreased performance in the repository. But given enough unreachable objects, this can lead to inode starvation and degrade the performance of the whole system. Since we can never pack those objects, these repositories often take up a large amount of disk space, since we can only zlib compress them, but not store them in delta chains.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_cruft_packs_2">
Cruft packs</h3>  <p>A cruft pack eliminates the need for storing unreachable objects in a loose state by including the per-object mtimes in a separate file alongside a single pack containing all loose objects.</p>   <p>A cruft pack is written by <code>git repack --cruft</code> when generating a new pack. <a href="git-pack-objects">git-pack-objects[1]</a>'s <code>--cruft</code> option. Note that <code>git repack --cruft</code> is a classic all-into-one repack, meaning that everything in the resulting pack is reachable, and everything else is unreachable. Once written, the <code>--cruft</code> option instructs <code>git repack</code> to generate another pack containing only objects not packed in the previous step (which equates to packing all unreachable objects together). This progresses as follows:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Enumerate every object, marking any object which is (a) not contained in a kept-pack, and (b) whose mtime is within the grace period as a traversal tip.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform a reachability traversal based on the tips gathered in the previous step, adding every object along the way to the pack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write the pack out, along with a <code>.mtimes</code> file that records the per-object timestamps.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>This mode is invoked internally by <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a> when instructed to write a cruft pack. Crucially, the set of in-core kept packs is exactly the set of packs which will not be deleted by the repack; in other words, they contain all of the repository’s reachable objects.</p>   <p>When a repository already has a cruft pack, <code>git repack --cruft</code> typically only adds objects to it. An exception to this is when <code>git repack</code> is given the <code>--cruft-expiration</code> option, which allows the generated cruft pack to omit expired objects instead of waiting for <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a> to expire those objects later on.</p>   <p>It is <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a> that is typically responsible for removing expired unreachable objects.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_caution_for_mixed_version_environments">
Caution for mixed-version environments</h3>  <p>Repositories that have cruft packs in them will continue to work with any older version of Git. Note, however, that previous versions of Git which do not understand the <code>.mtimes</code> file will use the cruft pack’s mtime as the mtime for all of the objects in it. In other words, do not expect older (pre-cruft pack) versions of Git to interpret or even read the contents of the <code>.mtimes</code> file.</p>   <p>Note that having mixed versions of Git GC-ing the same repository can lead to unreachable objects never being completely pruned. This can happen under the following circumstances:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>An older version of Git running GC explodes the contents of an existing cruft pack loose, using the cruft pack’s mtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>A newer version running GC collects those loose objects into a cruft pack, where the .mtime file reflects the loose object’s actual mtimes, but the cruft pack mtime is "now".</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Repeating this process will lead to unreachable objects not getting pruned as a result of repeatedly resetting the objects' mtimes to the present time.</p>   <p>If you are GC-ing repositories in a mixed version environment, consider omitting the <code>--cruft</code> option when using <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a> and <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a>, and setting the <code>gc.cruftPacks</code> configuration to "false" until all writers understand cruft packs.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_alternatives">
Alternatives</h3>  <p>Notable alternatives to this design include:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The location of the per-object mtime data, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Storing unreachable objects in multiple cruft packs.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>On the location of mtime data, a new auxiliary file tied to the pack was chosen to avoid complicating the <code>.idx</code> format. If the <code>.idx</code> format were ever to gain support for optional chunks of data, it may make sense to consolidate the <code>.mtimes</code> format into the <code>.idx</code> itself.</p>   <p>Storing unreachable objects among multiple cruft packs (e.g., creating a new cruft pack during each repacking operation including only unreachable objects which aren’t already stored in an earlier cruft pack) is significantly more complicated to construct, and so aren’t pursued here. The obvious drawback to the current implementation is that the entire cruft pack must be re-written from scratch.</p>  </div> </div>
