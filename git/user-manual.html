How to get a Git repository</h3>  <p>It will be useful to have a Git repository to experiment with as you read this manual.</p>   <p>The best way to get one is by using the <a href="git-clone">git-clone[1]</a> command to download a copy of an existing repository. If you don’t already have a project in mind, here are some interesting examples:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        # Git itself (approx. 40MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        # the Linux kernel (approx. 640MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you will only need to clone once.</p>   <p>The clone command creates a new directory named after the project (<code>git</code> or <code>linux</code> in the examples above). After you cd into this directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files, called the <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, together with a special top-level directory named <code>.git</code>, which contains all the information about the history of the project.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="how-to-check-out">
How to check out a different version of a project</h3>  <p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection of files. It stores the history as a compressed collection of interrelated snapshots of the project’s contents. In Git each such version is called a <a href="#def_commit">commit</a>.</p>   <p>Those snapshots aren’t necessarily all arranged in a single line from oldest to newest; instead, work may simultaneously proceed along parallel lines of development, called <a href="#def_branch">branches</a>, which may merge and diverge.</p>   <p>A single Git repository can track development on multiple branches. It does this by keeping a list of <a href="#def_head">heads</a> which reference the latest commit on each branch; the <a href="git-branch">git-branch[1]</a> command shows you the list of branch heads:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch
* master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch head, by default named "master", with the working directory initialized to the state of the project referred to by that branch head.</p>   <p>Most projects also use <a href="#def_tag">tags</a>. Tags, like heads, are references into the project’s history, and can be listed using the <a href="git-tag">git-tag[1]</a> command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git tag -l
v2.6.11
v2.6.11-tree
v2.6.12
v2.6.12-rc2
v2.6.12-rc3
v2.6.12-rc4
v2.6.12-rc5
v2.6.12-rc6
v2.6.13
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Tags are expected to always point at the same version of a project, while heads are expected to advance as development progresses.</p>   <p>Create a new branch head pointing to one of these versions and check it out using <a href="git-switch">git-switch[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch -c new v2.6.13</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The working directory then reflects the contents that the project had when it was tagged v2.6.13, and <a href="git-branch">git-branch[1]</a> shows two branches, with an asterisk marking the currently checked-out branch:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch
  master
* new</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you decide that you’d rather see version 2.6.17, you can modify the current branch to point at v2.6.17 instead, with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git reset --hard v2.6.17</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note that if the current branch head was your only reference to a particular point in history, then resetting that branch may leave you with no way to find the history it used to point to; so use this command carefully.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="understanding-commits">
Understanding History: Commits</h3>  <p>Every change in the history of a project is represented by a commit. The <a href="git-show">git-show[1]</a> command shows the most recent commit on the current branch:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show

         if (mkdir(".git", 0755) &lt; 0) {</pre> </div> </div>  <p>As you can see, a commit shows who made the latest change, what they did, and why.</p>   <p>Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name" or the "SHA-1 id", shown on the first line of the <code>git show</code> output. You can usually refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as a tag or a branch name, but this longer name can also be useful. Most importantly, it is a globally unique name for this commit: so if you tell somebody else the object name (for example in email), then you are guaranteed that name will refer to the same commit in their repository that it does in yours (assuming their repository has that commit at all). Since the object name is computed as a hash over the contents of the commit, you are guaranteed that the commit can never change without its name also changing.</p>   <p>In fact, in <a href="#git-concepts">Git concepts</a> we shall see that everything stored in Git history, including file data and directory contents, is stored in an object with a name that is a hash of its contents.</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="understanding-reachability">
Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</h4>  <p>Every commit (except the very first commit in a project) also has a parent commit which shows what happened before this commit. Following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the beginning of the project.</p>   <p>However, the commits do not form a simple list; Git allows lines of development to diverge and then reconverge, and the point where two lines of development reconverge is called a "merge". The commit representing a merge can therefore have more than one parent, with each parent representing the most recent commit on one of the lines of development leading to that point.</p>   <p>The best way to see how this works is using the <a href="gitk">gitk[1]</a> command; running gitk now on a Git repository and looking for merge commits will help understand how Git organizes history.</p>   <p>In the following, we say that commit X is "reachable" from commit Y if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y. Equivalently, you could say that Y is a descendant of X, or that there is a chain of parents leading from commit Y to commit X.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="history-diagrams">
Understanding history: History diagrams</h4>  <p>We will sometimes represent Git history using diagrams like the one below. Commits are shown as "o", and the links between them with lines drawn with - / and \. Time goes left to right:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch A
        /
 o--o--o &lt;-- master
        \
         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch B</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If we need to talk about a particular commit, the character "o" may be replaced with another letter or number.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="what-is-a-branch">
Understanding history: What is a branch?</h4>  <p>When we need to be precise, we will use the word "branch" to mean a line of development, and "branch head" (or just "head") to mean a reference to the most recent commit on a branch. In the example above, the branch head named "A" is a pointer to one particular commit, but we refer to the line of three commits leading up to that point as all being part of "branch A".</p>   <p>However, when no confusion will result, we often just use the term "branch" both for branches and for branch heads.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="manipulating-branches">
Manipulating branches</h3>  <p>Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here’s a summary of the commands:</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitbranchcode"> <code>git branch</code> </dt> <dd> <p>list all branches.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitbranchltbranchgtcode"> <code>git branch &lt;branch&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>create a new branch named <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>, referencing the same point in history as the current branch.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitbranchltbranchgtltstart-pointgtcode"> <code>git branch &lt;branch&gt; &lt;start-point&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>create a new branch named <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>, referencing <code>&lt;start-point&gt;</code>, which may be specified any way you like, including using a branch name or a tag name.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitbranch-dltbranchgtcode"> <code>git branch -d &lt;branch&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>delete the branch <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>; if the branch is not fully merged in its upstream branch or contained in the current branch, this command will fail with a warning.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitbranch-Dltbranchgtcode"> <code>git branch -D &lt;branch&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>delete the branch <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> irrespective of its merged status.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitswitchltbranchgtcode"> <code>git switch &lt;branch&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>make the current branch <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>, updating the working directory to reflect the version referenced by <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/user-manual.txt-codegitswitch-cltnewgtltstart-pointgtcode"> <code>git switch -c &lt;new&gt; &lt;start-point&gt;</code> </dt> <dd> <p>create a new branch <code>&lt;new&gt;</code> referencing <code>&lt;start-point&gt;</code>, and check it out.</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <p>The special symbol "HEAD" can always be used to refer to the current branch. In fact, Git uses a file named <code>HEAD</code> in the <code>.git</code> directory to remember which branch is current:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="detached-head">
Examining an old version without creating a new branch</h3>  <p>The <code>git switch</code> command normally expects a branch head, but will also accept an arbitrary commit when invoked with --detach; for example, you can check out the commit referenced by a tag:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch --detach v2.6.17
Note: checking out 'v2.6.17'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another switch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command again. Example:

  git switch -c new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 427abfa Linux v2.6.17</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The HEAD then refers to the SHA-1 of the commit instead of to a branch, and git branch shows that you are no longer on a branch:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat .git/HEAD
427abfa28afedffadfca9dd8b067eb6d36bac53f
$ git branch
* (detached from v2.6.17)
  master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this case we say that the HEAD is "detached".</p>   <p>This is an easy way to check out a particular version without having to make up a name for the new branch. You can still create a new branch (or tag) for this version later if you decide to.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="examining-remote-branches">
Examining branches from a remote repository</h3>  <p>The "master" branch that was created at the time you cloned is a copy of the HEAD in the repository that you cloned from. That repository may also have had other branches, though, and your local repository keeps branches which track each of those remote branches, called remote-tracking branches, which you can view using the <code>-r</code> option to <a href="git-branch">git-branch[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD
  origin/html
  origin/maint
  origin/man
  origin/master
  origin/next
  origin/seen
  origin/todo</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this example, "origin" is called a remote repository, or "remote" for short. The branches of this repository are called "remote branches" from our point of view. The remote-tracking branches listed above were created based on the remote branches at clone time and will be updated by <code>git fetch</code> (hence <code>git pull</code>) and <code>git push</code>. See <a href="#Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch">Updating a repository with git fetch</a> for details.</p>   <p>You might want to build on one of these remote-tracking branches on a branch of your own, just as you would for a tag:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch -c my-todo-copy origin/todo</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can also check out <code>origin/todo</code> directly to examine it or write a one-off patch. See <a href="#detached-head">detached head</a>.</p>   <p>Note that the name "origin" is just the name that Git uses by default to refer to the repository that you cloned from.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="how-git-stores-references">
Naming branches, tags, and other references</h3>  <p>Branches, remote-tracking branches, and tags are all references to commits. All references are named with a slash-separated path name starting with <code>refs</code>; the names we’ve been using so far are actually shorthand:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The branch <code>test</code> is short for <code>refs/heads/test</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The tag <code>v2.6.18</code> is short for <code>refs/tags/v2.6.18</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>origin/master</code> is short for <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p>   <p>(Newly created refs are actually stored in the <code>.git/refs</code> directory, under the path given by their name. However, for efficiency reasons they may also be packed together in a single file; see <a href="git-pack-refs">git-pack-refs[1]</a>).</p>   <p>As another useful shortcut, the "HEAD" of a repository can be referred to just using the name of that repository. So, for example, "origin" is usually a shortcut for the HEAD branch in the repository "origin".</p>   <p>For the complete list of paths which Git checks for references, and the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple references with the same shorthand name, see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of <a href="gitrevisions">gitrevisions[7]</a>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch">
Updating a repository with git fetch</h3>  <p>After you clone a repository and commit a few changes of your own, you may wish to check the original repository for updates.</p>   <p>The <code>git-fetch</code> command, with no arguments, will update all of the remote-tracking branches to the latest version found in the original repository. It will not touch any of your own branches—​not even the "master" branch that was created for you on clone.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="fetching-branches">
Fetching branches from other repositories</h3>  <p>You can also track branches from repositories other than the one you cloned from, using <a href="git-remote">git-remote[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git remote add staging git://git.kernel.org/.../gregkh/staging.git
$ git fetch staging
...
From git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging

 * [new branch]      staging-linus -&gt; staging/staging-linus
 * [new branch]      staging-next -&gt; staging/staging-next</pre> </div> </div>  <p>New remote-tracking branches will be stored under the shorthand name that you gave <code>git remote add</code>, in this case <code>staging</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
  origin/master
  staging/master
  staging/staging-linus
  staging/staging-next</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you run <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code> later, the remote-tracking branches for the named <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> will be updated.</p>   <p>If you examine the file <code>.git/config</code>, you will see that Git has added a new stanza:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat .git/config
...
[remote "staging"]
        url = git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/staging/*
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is what causes Git to track the remote’s branches; you may modify or delete these configuration options by editing <code>.git/config</code> with a text editor. (See the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for details.)</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="exploring-git-history">Exploring git history</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection of files. It does this by storing compressed snapshots of the contents of a file hierarchy, together with "commits" which show the relationships between these snapshots.</p>   <p>Git provides extremely flexible and fast tools for exploring the history of a project.</p>   <p>We start with one specialized tool that is useful for finding the commit that introduced a bug into a project.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="using-bisect">
How to use bisect to find a regression</h3>  <p>Suppose version 2.6.18 of your project worked, but the version at "master" crashes. Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project’s history to find the particular commit that caused the problem. The <a href="git-bisect">git-bisect[1]</a> command can help you do this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect start
$ git bisect good v2.6.18
$ git bisect bad master

HEAD is now detached from any branch and points directly to a commit (with commit id 65934) that is reachable from "master" but not from v2.6.18. Compile and test it, and see whether it crashes. Assume it does crash. Then:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect bad

Continue like this, telling Git at each stage whether the version it gives you is good or bad, and notice that the number of revisions left to test is cut approximately in half each time.</p>   <p>After about 13 tests (in this case), it will output the commit id of the guilty commit. You can then examine the commit with <a href="git-show">git-show[1]</a>, find out who wrote it, and mail them your bug report with the commit id. Finally, run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect reset</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to return you to the branch you were on before.</p>   <p>Note that the version which <code>git bisect</code> checks out for you at each point is just a suggestion, and you’re free to try a different version if you think it would be a good idea. For example, occasionally you may land on a commit that broke something unrelated; run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect visualize</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will run gitk and label the commit it chose with a marker that says "bisect". Choose a safe-looking commit nearby, note its commit id, and check it out with:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git reset --hard fb47ddb2db</pre> </div> </div>  <p>then test, run <code>bisect good</code> or <code>bisect bad</code> as appropriate, and continue.</p>   <p>Instead of <code>git bisect visualize</code> and then <code>git reset --hard
fb47ddb2db</code>, you might just want to tell Git that you want to skip the current commit:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect skip</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this case, though, Git may not eventually be able to tell the first bad one between some first skipped commits and a later bad commit.</p>   <p>There are also ways to automate the bisecting process if you have a test script that can tell a good from a bad commit. See <a href="git-bisect">git-bisect[1]</a> for more information about this and other <code>git
bisect</code> features.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="naming-commits">
Naming commits</h3>  <p>We have seen several ways of naming commits already:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>40-hexdigit object name</p> </li> <li> <p>branch name: refers to the commit at the head of the given branch</p> </li> <li> <p>tag name: refers to the commit pointed to by the given tag (we’ve seen branches and tags are special cases of <a href="#how-git-stores-references">references</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>HEAD: refers to the head of the current branch</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>There are many more; see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of the <a href="gitrevisions">gitrevisions[7]</a> man page for the complete list of ways to name revisions. Some examples:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show fb47ddb2 # the first few characters of the object name
                    # are usually enough to specify it uniquely
$ git show HEAD^    # the parent of the HEAD commit
$ git show HEAD^^   # the grandparent
$ git show HEAD~4   # the great-great-grandparent</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Recall that merge commits may have more than one parent; by default, <code>^</code> and <code>~</code> follow the first parent listed in the commit, but you can also choose:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show HEAD^1   # show the first parent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD^2   # show the second parent of HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In addition to HEAD, there are several other special names for commits:</p>   <p>Merges (to be discussed later), as well as operations such as <code>git reset</code>, which change the currently checked-out commit, generally set ORIG_HEAD to the value HEAD had before the current operation.</p>   <p>The <code>git fetch</code> operation always stores the head of the last fetched branch in FETCH_HEAD. For example, if you run <code>git fetch</code> without specifying a local branch as the target of the operation</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git theirbranch</pre> </div> </div>  <p>the fetched commits will still be available from FETCH_HEAD.</p>   <p>When we discuss merges we’ll also see the special name MERGE_HEAD, which refers to the other branch that we’re merging in to the current branch.</p>   <p>The <a href="git-rev-parse">git-rev-parse[1]</a> command is a low-level command that is occasionally useful for translating some name for a commit to the object name for that commit:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git rev-parse origin
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="creating-tags">
Creating tags</h3>  <p>We can also create a tag to refer to a particular commit; after running</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git tag stable-1 1b2e1d63ff</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can use <code>stable-1</code> to refer to the commit 1b2e1d63ff.</p>   <p>This creates a "lightweight" tag. If you would also like to include a comment with the tag, and possibly sign it cryptographically, then you should create a tag object instead; see the <a href="git-tag">git-tag[1]</a> man page for details.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="browsing-revisions">
Browsing revisions</h3>  <p>The <a href="git-log">git-log[1]</a> command can show lists of commits. On its own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you can also make more specific requests:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log v2.5..        # commits since (not reachable from) v2.5
$ git log test..master        # commits reachable from master but not test
$ git log master..test        # ...reachable from test but not master
$ git log master...test        # ...reachable from either test or master,
                        #    but not both
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log Makefile      # commits which modify Makefile
$ git log fs/                # ... which modify any file under fs/
$ git log -S'foo()'        # commits which add or remove any file data
                        # matching the string 'foo()'</pre> </div> </div>  <p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds commits since v2.5 which touch the <code>Makefile</code> or any file under <code>fs</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log v2.5..

Generating diffs</h3>  <p>You can generate diffs between any two versions using <a href="git-diff">git-diff[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff master..test</pre> </div> </div>  <p>That will produce the diff between the tips of the two branches.

Viewing old file versions</h3>  <p>You can always view an old version of a file by just checking out the correct revision first. But sometimes it is more convenient to be able to view an old version of a single file without checking anything out; this command does that:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show v2.5:fs/locks.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Before the colon may be anything that names a commit, and after it may be any path to a file tracked by Git.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="history-examples">

v1.5.0-rc0-260-ge05db0f</pre> </div> </div>  <p>but that may sometimes help you guess which tags might come after the given commit.</p>   <p>If you just want to verify whether a given tagged version contains a given commit, you could use <a href="git-merge-base">git-merge-base[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge-base e05db0fd v1.5.0-rc1

The command <code>git diff --cached</code>, which shows the difference between the HEAD and the index, should therefore produce no output at that point.</p>   <p>Modifying the index is easy:</p>   <p>To update the index with the contents of a new or modified file, use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git add path/to/file</pre> </div> </div>  <p>To remove a file from the index and from the working tree, use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git rm path/to/file</pre> </div> </div>  <p>After each step you can verify that</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff --cached</pre> </div> </div>  <p>always shows the difference between the HEAD and the index file—​this is what you’d commit if you created the commit now—​and that</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff</pre> </div> </div>  <p>shows the difference between the working tree and the index file.</p>   <p>Note that <code>git add</code> always adds just the current contents of a file to the index; further changes to the same file will be ignored unless you run <code>git add</code> on the file again.</p>   <p>When you’re ready, just run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and Git will prompt you for a commit message and then create the new commit.

Creating good commit messages</h3>  <p>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, <a href="git-format-patch">git-format-patch[1]</a> turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="ignoring-files">
Ignoring files</h3>  <p>A project will often generate files that you do <code>not</code> want to track with Git. This typically includes files generated by a build process or temporary backup files made by your editor. Of course, <code>not</code> tracking files with Git is just a matter of <code>not</code> calling <code>git add</code> on them. But it quickly becomes annoying to have these untracked files lying around; e.g. they make <code>git add .</code> practically useless, and they keep showing up in the output of <code>git status</code>.</p>   <p>You can tell Git to ignore certain files by creating a file called <code>.gitignore</code> in the top level of your working directory, with contents such as:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre># Lines starting with '#' are considered comments.
# Ignore any file named foo.txt.
foo.txt
# Ignore (generated) html files,
*.html
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand.
!foo.html
# Ignore objects and archives.
*.[oa]</pre> </div> </div>  <p>See <a href="gitignore">gitignore[5]</a> for a detailed explanation of the syntax. You can also place .gitignore files in other directories in your working tree, and they will apply to those directories and their subdirectories. The <code>.gitignore</code> files can be added to your repository like any other files (just run <code>git add
.gitignore</code> and <code>git commit</code>, as usual), which is convenient when the exclude patterns (such as patterns matching build output files) would also make sense for other users who clone your repository.</p>   <p>If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories (instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put them in a file in your repository named <code>.git/info/exclude</code>, or in any file specified by the <code>core.excludesFile</code> configuration variable. Some Git commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the command line. See <a href="gitignore">gitignore[5]</a> for the details.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="how-to-merge">
How to merge</h3>  <p>You can rejoin two diverging branches of development using <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge branchname</pre> </div> </div>  <p>merges the development in the branch <code>branchname</code> into the current branch.</p>   <p>A merge is made by combining the changes made in <code>branchname</code> and the changes made up to the latest commit in your current branch since their histories forked. The work tree is overwritten by the result of the merge when this combining is done cleanly, or overwritten by a half-merged results when this combining results in conflicts. Therefore, if you have uncommitted changes touching the same files as the ones impacted by the merge, Git will refuse to proceed. Most of the time, you will want to commit your changes before you can merge, and if you don’t, then <a href="git-stash">git-stash[1]</a> can take these changes away while you’re doing the merge, and reapply them afterwards.</p>   <p>If the changes are independent enough, Git will automatically complete the merge and commit the result (or reuse an existing commit in case of <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>, see below). On the other hand, if there are conflicts—​for example, if the same file is modified in two different ways in the remote branch and the local branch—​then you are warned; the output may look something like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge next

Resolving a merge</h3>  <p>When a merge isn’t resolved automatically, Git leaves the index and the working tree in a special state that gives you all the information you need to help resolve the merge.</p>   <p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you resolve the problem and update the index, <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> will fail:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit

Each of these three "file stages" represents a different version of the file:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show :1:file.txt        # the file in a common ancestor of both branches

Same for stage 3).</p>   <p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version of file.txt and the stage 2 and stage 3 versions.

Fast-forward merges</h3>  <p>There is one special case not mentioned above, which is treated differently.

Fixing a mistake with a new commit</h4>  <p>Creating a new commit that reverts an earlier change is very easy; just pass the <a href="git-revert">git-revert[1]</a> command a reference to the bad commit; for example, to revert the most recent commit:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git revert HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will create a new commit which undoes the change in HEAD.

Checking out an old version of a file</h4>  <p>In the process of undoing a previous bad change, you may find it useful to check out an older version of a particular file using <a href="git-restore">git-restore[1]</a>.

Recovering lost changes</h4> <div class="sect4"> <h5 id="reflogs">
Reflogs</h5>  <p>Say you modify a branch with <a href="#fixing-mistakes"><code>git reset --hard</code></a>, and then realize that the branch was the only reference you had to that point in history.</p>   <p>Fortunately, Git also keeps a log, called a "reflog", of all the previous values of each branch. So in this case you can still find the old history using, for example,</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log master@{1}</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This lists the commits reachable from the previous version of the <code>master</code> branch head. This syntax can be used with any Git command that accepts a commit, not just with <code>git log</code>. Some other examples:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show master@{2}                # See where the branch pointed 2,
$ git show master@{3}                # 3, ... changes ago.
$ gitk master@{yesterday}        # See where it pointed yesterday,
$ gitk master@{"1 week ago"}        # ... or last week
$ git log --walk-reflogs master        # show reflog entries for master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>A separate reflog is kept for the HEAD, so</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show HEAD@{"1 week ago"}</pre> </div> </div>  <p>will show what HEAD pointed to one week ago, not what the current branch pointed to one week ago. This allows you to see the history of what you’ve checked out.</p>   <p>The reflogs are kept by default for 30 days, after which they may be pruned. See <a href="git-reflog">git-reflog[1]</a> and <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a> to learn how to control this pruning, and see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of <a href="gitrevisions">gitrevisions[7]</a> for details.</p>   <p>Note that the reflog history is very different from normal Git history. While normal history is shared by every repository that works on the same project, the reflog history is not shared: it tells you only about how the branches in your local repository have changed over time.</p>  </div> <div class="sect4"> <h5 id="dangling-object-recovery">
Examining dangling objects</h5>  <p>In some situations the reflog may not be able to save you. For example, suppose you delete a branch, then realize you need the history it contained.

(The <code>-3</code> option tells Git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p>   <p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git am --continue</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and Git will create the commit for you and continue applying the remaining patches from the mailbox.</p>   <p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each taken from the message containing each patch.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="public-repositories">
Public Git repositories</h3>  <p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer of that project to pull the changes from your repository using <a href="git-pull">git-pull[1]</a>. In the section "<a href="#getting-updates-With-git-pull">Getting updates with <code>git pull</code></a>" we described this as a way to get updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the other direction.</p>   <p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then you can just pull changes from each other’s repositories directly; commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a local directory name:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone /path/to/repository
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or an ssh URL:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private repositories, this may be all you need.</p>   <p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes from. This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p>   <p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to pull from that repository. So the flow of changes, in a situation where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks like this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                      you push
your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo
      ^                                     |
      |                                     |
      | you pull                            | they pull
      |                                     |
      |                                     |
      |               they push             V
their public repo &lt;------------------- their repo</pre> </div> </div>  <p>We explain how to do this in the following sections.</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="setting-up-a-public-repository">
Setting up a public repository</h4>  <p>Assume your personal repository is in the directory <code>~/proj</code>. We first create a new clone of the repository and tell <code>git daemon</code> that it is meant to be public:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone --bare ~/proj proj.git
$ touch proj.git/git-daemon-export-ok</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The resulting directory proj.git contains a "bare" git repository—​it is just the contents of the <code>.git</code> directory, without any files checked out around it.</p>   <p>Next, copy <code>proj.git</code> to the server where you plan to host the public repository. You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most convenient.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="exporting-via-git">
Exporting a Git repository via the Git protocol</h4>  <p>This is the preferred method.</p>   <p>If someone else administers the server, they should tell you what directory to put the repository in, and what <code>git://</code> URL it will appear at. You can then skip to the section "<a href="#pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository">Pushing changes to a public repository</a>", below.</p>   <p>Otherwise, all you need to do is start <a href="git-daemon">git-daemon[1]</a>; it will listen on port 9418. By default, it will allow access to any directory that looks like a Git directory and contains the magic file git-daemon-export-ok. Passing some directory paths as <code>git daemon</code> arguments will further restrict the exports to those paths.</p>   <p>You can also run <code>git daemon</code> as an inetd service; see the <a href="git-daemon">git-daemon[1]</a> man page for details. (See especially the examples section.)</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="exporting-via-http">
Exporting a git repository via HTTP</h4>  <p>The Git protocol gives better performance and reliability, but on a host with a web server set up, HTTP exports may be simpler to set up.</p>   <p>All you need to do is place the newly created bare Git repository in a directory that is exported by the web server, and make some adjustments to give web clients some extra information they need:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mv proj.git /home/you/public_html/proj.git
$ cd proj.git
$ git --bare update-server-info
$ mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(For an explanation of the last two lines, see <a href="git-update-server-info">git-update-server-info[1]</a> and <a href="githooks">githooks[5]</a>.)</p>   <p>Advertise the URL of <code>proj.git</code>. Anybody else should then be able to clone or pull from that URL, for example with a command line like:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone http://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(See also <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/howto/setup-git-server-over-http">setup-git-server-over-http</a> for a slightly more sophisticated setup using WebDAV which also allows pushing over HTTP.)</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository">
Pushing changes to a public repository</h4>  <p>Note that the two techniques outlined above (exporting via <a href="#exporting-via-http">http</a> or <a href="#exporting-via-git">git</a>) allow other maintainers to fetch your latest changes, but they do not allow write access, which you will need to update the public repository with the latest changes created in your private repository.</p>   <p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href="git-push">git-push[1]</a> and ssh; to update the remote branch named <code>master</code> with the latest state of your branch named <code>master</code>, run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master:master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or just</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>As with <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git push</code> will complain if this does not result in a <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>; see the following section for details on handling this case.</p>   <p>Note that the target of a <code>push</code> is normally a <a href="#def_bare_repository">bare</a> repository. You can also push to a repository that has a checked-out working tree, but a push to update the currently checked-out branch is denied by default to prevent confusion. See the description of the receive.denyCurrentBranch option in <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for details.</p>   <p>As with <code>git fetch</code>, you may also set up configuration options to save typing; so, for example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git remote add public-repo ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git</pre> </div> </div>  <p>adds the following to <code>.git/config</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[remote "public-repo"]
        url = yourserver.com:proj.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/example/*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which lets you do the same push with just</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push public-repo master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>See the explanations of the <code>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</code>, <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code>, and <code>remote.&lt;name&gt;.push</code> options in <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for details.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="forcing-push">
What to do when a push fails</h4>  <p>If a push would not result in a <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a> of the remote branch, then it will fail with an error like:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '...'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>use <code>git reset --hard</code> to remove already-published commits, or</p> </li> <li> <p>use <code>git commit --amend</code> to replace already-published commits (as in <a href="#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history">Fixing a mistake by rewriting history</a>), or</p> </li> <li> <p>use <code>git rebase</code> to rebase any already-published commits (as in <a href="#using-git-rebase">Keeping a patch series up to date using git rebase</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>You may force <code>git push</code> to perform the update anyway by preceding the branch name with a plus sign:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note the addition of the <code>+</code> sign. Alternatively, you can use the <code>-f</code> flag to force the remote update, as in:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push -f ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to before. By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention. (See <a href="#problems-With-rewriting-history">Problems with rewriting history</a>.)</p>   <p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you intend to manage the branch.</p>   <p>It’s also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have the right to push to the same repository. In that case, the correct solution is to retry the push after first updating your work: either by a pull, or by a fetch followed by a rebase; see the <a href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository">next section</a> and <a href="gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration[7]</a> for more.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="setting-up-a-shared-repository">
Setting up a shared repository</h4>  <p>Another way to collaborate is by using a model similar to that commonly used in CVS, where several developers with special rights all push to and pull from a single shared repository. See <a href="gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration[7]</a> for instructions on how to set this up.</p>   <p>However, while there is nothing wrong with Git’s support for shared repositories, this mode of operation is not generally recommended, simply because the mode of collaboration that Git supports—​by exchanging patches and pulling from public repositories—​has so many advantages over the central shared repository:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Git’s ability to quickly import and merge patches allows a single maintainer to process incoming changes even at very high rates. And when that becomes too much, <code>git pull</code> provides an easy way for that maintainer to delegate this job to other maintainers while still allowing optional review of incoming changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since every developer’s repository has the same complete copy of the project history, no repository is special, and it is trivial for another developer to take over maintenance of a project, either by mutual agreement, or because a maintainer becomes unresponsive or difficult to work with.</p> </li> <li> <p>The lack of a central group of "committers" means there is less need for formal decisions about who is "in" and who is "out".</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="setting-up-gitweb">
Allowing web browsing of a repository</h4>  <p>The gitweb cgi script provides users an easy way to browse your project’s revisions, file contents and logs without having to install Git. Features like RSS/Atom feeds and blame/annotation details may optionally be enabled.</p>   <p>The <a href="git-instaweb">git-instaweb[1]</a> command provides a simple way to start browsing the repository using gitweb. The default server when using instaweb is lighttpd.</p>   <p>See the file gitweb/INSTALL in the Git source tree and <a href="gitweb">gitweb[1]</a> for instructions on details setting up a permanent installation with a CGI or Perl capable server.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="how-to-get-a-git-repository-with-minimal-history">
How to get a Git repository with minimal history</h3>  <p>A <a href="#def_shallow_clone">shallow clone</a>, with its truncated history, is useful when one is interested only in recent history of a project and getting full history from the upstream is expensive.</p>   <p>A <a href="#def_shallow_clone">shallow clone</a> is created by specifying the <a href="git-clone">git-clone[1]</a> <code>--depth</code> switch. The depth can later be changed with the <a href="git-fetch">git-fetch[1]</a> <code>--depth</code> switch, or full history restored with <code>--unshallow</code>.</p>   <p>Merging inside a <a href="#def_shallow_clone">shallow clone</a> will work as long as a merge base is in the recent history. Otherwise, it will be like merging unrelated histories and may have to result in huge conflicts. This limitation may make such a repository unsuitable to be used in merge based workflows.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="sharing-development-examples">
Examples</h3> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="maintaining-topic-branches">
Maintaining topic branches for a Linux subsystem maintainer</h4>  <p>This describes how Tony Luck uses Git in his role as maintainer of the IA64 architecture for the Linux kernel.</p>   <p>He uses two public branches:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>A "test" tree into which patches are initially placed so that they can get some exposure when integrated with other ongoing development. This tree is available to Andrew for pulling into -mm whenever he wants.</p> </li> <li> <p>A "release" tree into which tested patches are moved for final sanity checking, and as a vehicle to send them upstream to Linus (by sending him a "please pull" request.)</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>He also uses a set of temporary branches ("topic branches"), each containing a logical grouping of patches.</p>   <p>To set this up, first create your work tree by cloning Linus’s public tree:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git work
$ cd work</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Linus’s tree will be stored in the remote-tracking branch named origin/master, and can be updated using <a href="git-fetch">git-fetch[1]</a>; you can track other public trees using <a href="git-remote">git-remote[1]</a> to set up a "remote" and <a href="git-fetch">git-fetch[1]</a> to keep them up to date; see <a href="#repositories-and-branches">Repositories and Branches</a>.</p>   <p>Now create the branches in which you are going to work; these start out at the current tip of origin/master branch, and should be set up (using the <code>--track</code> option to <a href="git-branch">git-branch[1]</a>) to merge changes in from Linus by default.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch --track test origin/master
$ git branch --track release origin/master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>These can be easily kept up to date using <a href="git-pull">git-pull[1]</a>.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch test &amp;&amp; git pull
$ git switch release &amp;&amp; git pull</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Important note! If you have any local changes in these branches, then this merge will create a commit object in the history (with no local changes Git will simply do a "fast-forward" merge). Many people dislike the "noise" that this creates in the Linux history, so you should avoid doing this capriciously in the <code>release</code> branch, as these noisy commits will become part of the permanent history when you ask Linus to pull from the release branch.</p>   <p>A few configuration variables (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>) can make it easy to push both branches to your public tree. (See <a href="#setting-up-a-public-repository">Setting up a public repository</a>.)</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat &gt;&gt; .git/config &lt;&lt;EOF

        push = release
        push = test
EOF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then you can push both the test and release trees using <a href="git-push">git-push[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push mytree</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or push just one of the test and release branches using:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push mytree test</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push mytree release</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Now to apply some patches from the community. Think of a short snappy name for a branch to hold this patch (or related group of patches), and create a new branch from a recent stable tag of Linus’s branch. Picking a stable base for your branch will: 1) help you: by avoiding inclusion of unrelated and perhaps lightly tested changes 2) help future bug hunters that use <code>git bisect</code> to find problems</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch -c speed-up-spinlocks v2.6.35</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Now you apply the patch(es), run some tests, and commit the change(s). If the patch is a multi-part series, then you should apply each as a separate commit to this branch.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ ... patch ... test  ... commit [ ... patch ... test ... commit ]*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>When you are happy with the state of this change, you can merge it into the "test" branch in preparation to make it public:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch test &amp;&amp; git merge speed-up-spinlocks</pre> </div> </div>  <p>It is unlikely that you would have any conflicts here …​ but you might if you spent a while on this step and had also pulled new versions from upstream.</p>   <p>Sometime later when enough time has passed and testing done, you can pull the same branch into the <code>release</code> tree ready to go upstream. This is where you see the value of keeping each patch (or patch series) in its own branch. It means that the patches can be moved into the <code>release</code> tree in any order.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch release &amp;&amp; git merge speed-up-spinlocks</pre> </div> </div>  <p>After a while, you will have a number of branches, and despite the well chosen names you picked for each of them, you may forget what they are for, or what status they are in. To get a reminder of what changes are in a specific branch, use:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log linux..branchname | git shortlog</pre> </div> </div>  <p>To see whether it has already been merged into the test or release branches, use:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log test..branchname</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log release..branchname</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(If this branch has not yet been merged, you will see some log entries. If it has been merged, then there will be no output.)</p>   <p>Once a patch completes the great cycle (moving from test to release, then pulled by Linus, and finally coming back into your local <code>origin/master</code> branch), the branch for this change is no longer needed. You detect this when the output from:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log origin..branchname</pre> </div> </div>  <p>is empty. At this point the branch can be deleted:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch -d branchname</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Some changes are so trivial that it is not necessary to create a separate branch and then merge into each of the test and release branches. For these changes, just apply directly to the <code>release</code> branch, and then merge that into the <code>test</code> branch.</p>   <p>After pushing your work to <code>mytree</code>, you can use <a href="git-request-pull">git-request-pull[1]</a> to prepare a "please pull" request message to send to Linus:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git push mytree

Creating the perfect patch series</h3>  <p>Suppose you are a contributor to a large project, and you want to add a complicated feature, and to present it to the other developers in a way that makes it easy for them to read your changes, verify that they are correct, and understand why you made each change.</p>   <p>If you present all of your changes as a single patch (or commit), they may find that it is too much to digest all at once.</p>   <p>If you present them with the entire history of your work, complete with mistakes, corrections, and dead ends, they may be overwhelmed.</p>   <p>So the ideal is usually to produce a series of patches such that:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Each patch can be applied in order.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each patch includes a single logical change, together with a message explaining the change.</p> </li> <li> <p>No patch introduces a regression: after applying any initial part of the series, the resulting project still compiles and works, and has no bugs that it didn’t have before.</p> </li> <li> <p>The complete series produces the same end result as your own (probably much messier!) development process did.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>We will introduce some tools that can help you do this, explain how to use them, and then explain some of the problems that can arise because you are rewriting history.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="using-git-rebase">
Keeping a patch series up to date using git rebase</h3>  <p>Suppose that you create a branch <code>mywork</code> on a remote-tracking branch <code>origin</code>, and create some commits on top of it:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch -c mywork origin
$ vi file.txt
$ git commit
$ vi otherfile.txt
$ git commit
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You have performed no merges into mywork, so it is just a simple linear sequence of patches on top of <code>origin</code>:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--O &lt;-- origin
        \
         a--b--c &lt;-- mywork</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Some more interesting work has been done in the upstream project, and <code>origin</code> has advanced:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \
         a--b--c &lt;-- mywork</pre> </div> </div>  <p>At this point, you could use <code>pull</code> to merge your changes back in; the result would create a new merge commit, like this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \        \
         a--b--c--m &lt;-- mywork</pre> </div> </div>  <p>However, if you prefer to keep the history in mywork a simple series of commits without any merges, you may instead choose to use <a href="git-rebase">git-rebase[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch mywork
$ git rebase origin</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will remove each of your commits from mywork, temporarily saving them as patches (in a directory named <code>.git/rebase-apply</code>), update mywork to point at the latest version of origin, then apply each of the saved patches to the new mywork. The result will look like:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin

                  a'--b'--c' &lt;-- mywork</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In the process, it may discover conflicts.

Rewriting a single commit</h3>  <p>We saw in <a href="#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history">Fixing a mistake by rewriting history</a> that you can replace the most recent commit using</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit --amend</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will replace the old commit by a new commit incorporating your changes, giving you a chance to edit the old commit message first. This is useful for fixing typos in your last commit, or for adjusting the patch contents of a poorly staged commit.</p>   <p>If you need to amend commits from deeper in your history, you can use <a href="#interactive-rebase">interactive rebase’s <code>edit</code> instruction</a>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="reordering-patch-series">
Reordering or selecting from a patch series</h3>  <p>Sometimes you want to edit a commit deeper in your history. One approach is to use <code>git format-patch</code> to create a series of patches and then reset the state to before the patches:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git format-patch origin
$ git reset --hard origin</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then modify, reorder, or eliminate patches as needed before applying them again with <a href="git-am">git-am[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git am *.patch</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="interactive-rebase">
Using interactive rebases</h3>  <p>You can also edit a patch series with an interactive rebase. This is the same as <a href="#reordering-patch-series">reordering a patch series using <code>format-patch</code></a>, so use whichever interface you like best.</p>   <p>Rebase your current HEAD on the last commit you want to retain as-is. For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, use:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will open your editor with a list of steps to be taken to perform your rebase.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>pick deadbee The oneline of this commit

Once you are satisfied, save the list and close your editor, and the rebase will begin.</p>   <p>The rebase will stop where <code>pick</code> has been replaced with <code>edit</code> or when a step in the list fails to mechanically resolve conflicts and needs your help. When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with <code>git rebase --continue</code>. If you decide that things are getting too hairy, you can always bail out with <code>git rebase
--abort</code>.

Other tools</h3>  <p>There are numerous other tools, such as StGit, which exist for the purpose of maintaining a patch series. These are outside of the scope of this manual.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="problems-With-rewriting-history">
Problems with rewriting history</h3>  <p>The primary problem with rewriting the history of a branch has to do with merging. Suppose somebody fetches your branch and merges it into their branch, with a result something like this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then suppose you modify the last three commits:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>         o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
        /
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If we examined all this history together in one repository, it will look like:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>         o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
        /
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Git has no way of knowing that the new head is an updated version of the old head; it treats this situation exactly the same as it would if two developers had independently done the work on the old and new heads in parallel. At this point, if someone attempts to merge the new head in to their branch, Git will attempt to merge together the two (old and new) lines of development, instead of trying to replace the old by the new. The results are likely to be unexpected.</p>   <p>You may still choose to publish branches whose history is rewritten, and it may be useful for others to be able to fetch those branches in order to examine or test them, but they should not attempt to pull such branches into their own work.</p>   <p>For true distributed development that supports proper merging, published branches should never be rewritten.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="bisect-merges">
Why bisecting merge commits can be harder than bisecting linear history</h3>  <p>The <a href="git-bisect">git-bisect[1]</a> command correctly handles history that includes merge commits. However, when the commit that it finds is a merge commit, the user may need to work harder than usual to figure out why that commit introduced a problem.</p>   <p>Imagine this history:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>      ---Z---o---X---...---o---A---C---D
          \                       /
           o---o---Y---...---o---B</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Suppose that on the upper line of development, the meaning of one of the functions that exists at Z is changed at commit X. The commits from Z leading to A change both the function’s implementation and all calling sites that exist at Z, as well as new calling sites they add, to be consistent. There is no bug at A.</p>   <p>Suppose that in the meantime on the lower line of development somebody adds a new calling site for that function at commit Y. The commits from Z leading to B all assume the old semantics of that function and the callers and the callee are consistent with each other. There is no bug at B, either.</p>   <p>Suppose further that the two development lines merge cleanly at C, so no conflict resolution is required.</p>   <p>Nevertheless, the code at C is broken, because the callers added on the lower line of development have not been converted to the new semantics introduced on the upper line of development. So if all you know is that D is bad, that Z is good, and that <a href="git-bisect">git-bisect[1]</a> identifies C as the culprit, how will you figure out that the problem is due to this change in semantics?</p>   <p>When the result of a <code>git bisect</code> is a non-merge commit, you should normally be able to discover the problem by examining just that commit. Developers can make this easy by breaking their changes into small self-contained commits. That won’t help in the case above, however, because the problem isn’t obvious from examination of any single commit; instead, a global view of the development is required. To make matters worse, the change in semantics in the problematic function may be just one small part of the changes in the upper line of development.</p>   <p>On the other hand, if instead of merging at C you had rebased the history between Z to B on top of A, you would have gotten this linear history:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    ---Z---o---X--...---o---A---o---o---Y*--...---o---B*--D*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Bisecting between Z and D* would hit a single culprit commit Y*, and understanding why Y* was broken would probably be easier.</p>   <p>Partly for this reason, many experienced Git users, even when working on an otherwise merge-heavy project, keep the history linear by rebasing against the latest upstream version before publishing.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="advanced-branch-management">Advanced branch management</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="fetching-individual-branches">
Fetching individual branches</h3>  <p>Instead of using <a href="git-remote">git-remote[1]</a>, you can also choose just to update one branch at a time, and to store it locally under an arbitrary name:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch origin todo:my-todo-work</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The first argument, <code>origin</code>, just tells Git to fetch from the repository you originally cloned from. The second argument tells Git to fetch the branch named <code>todo</code> from the remote repository, and to store it locally under the name <code>refs/heads/my-todo-work</code>.</p>   <p>You can also fetch branches from other repositories; so</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git master:example-master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>will create a new branch named <code>example-master</code> and store in it the branch named <code>master</code> from the repository at the given URL. If you already have a branch named example-master, it will attempt to <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a> to the commit given by example.com’s master branch. In more detail:</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="fetch-fast-forwards">
git fetch and fast-forwards</h3>  <p>In the previous example, when updating an existing branch, <code>git fetch</code> checks to make sure that the most recent commit on the remote branch is a descendant of the most recent commit on your copy of the branch before updating your copy of the branch to point at the new commit. Git calls this process a <a href="#fast-forwards">fast-forward</a>.</p>   <p>A fast-forward looks something like this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of the branch
           \
            o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In some cases it is possible that the new head will <strong>not</strong> actually be a descendant of the old head. For example, the developer may have realized a serious mistake was made and decided to backtrack, resulting in a situation like:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> o--o--o--o--a--b &lt;-- old head of the branch
           \
            o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this case, <code>git fetch</code> will fail, and print out a warning.</p>   <p>In that case, you can still force Git to update to the new head, as described in the following section. However, note that in the situation above this may mean losing the commits labeled <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, unless you’ve already created a reference of your own pointing to them.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="forcing-fetch">
Forcing git fetch to do non-fast-forward updates</h3>  <p>If git fetch fails because the new head of a branch is not a descendant of the old head, you may force the update with:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git +master:refs/remotes/example/master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note the addition of the <code>+</code> sign. Alternatively, you can use the <code>-f</code> flag to force updates of all the fetched branches, as in:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch -f origin</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Be aware that commits that the old version of example/master pointed at may be lost, as we saw in the previous section.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="remote-branch-configuration">
Configuring remote-tracking branches</h3>  <p>We saw above that <code>origin</code> is just a shortcut to refer to the repository that you originally cloned from.

The Object Database</h3>  <p>We already saw in <a href="#understanding-commits">Understanding History: Commits</a> that all commits are stored under a 40-digit "object name". In fact, all the information needed to represent the history of a project is stored in objects with such names. In each case the name is calculated by taking the SHA-1 hash of the contents of the object. The SHA-1 hash is a cryptographic hash function. What that means to us is that it is impossible to find two different objects with the same name. This has a number of advantages; among others:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Git can quickly determine whether two objects are identical or not, just by comparing names.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since object names are computed the same way in every repository, the same content stored in two repositories will always be stored under the same name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Git can detect errors when it reads an object, by checking that the object’s name is still the SHA-1 hash of its contents.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>(See <a href="#object-details">Object storage format</a> for the details of the object formatting and SHA-1 calculation.)</p>   <p>There are four different types of objects: "blob", "tree", "commit", and "tag".</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>A <a href="#def_blob_object">"blob" object</a> is used to store file data.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <a href="#def_tree_object">"tree" object</a> ties one or more "blob" objects into a directory structure. In addition, a tree object can refer to other tree objects, thus creating a directory hierarchy.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <a href="#def_commit_object">"commit" object</a> ties such directory hierarchies together into a <a href="#def_DAG">directed acyclic graph</a> of revisions—​each commit contains the object name of exactly one tree designating the directory hierarchy at the time of the commit. In addition, a commit refers to "parent" commit objects that describe the history of how we arrived at that directory hierarchy.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <a href="#def_tag_object">"tag" object</a> symbolically identifies and can be used to sign other objects.

...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>A "blob" object is nothing but a binary blob of data. It doesn’t refer to anything else or have attributes of any kind.</p>   <p>Since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two files in a directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the repository) have the same contents, they will share the same blob object. The object is totally independent of its location in the directory tree, and renaming a file does not change the object that file is associated with.</p>   <p>Note that any tree or blob object can be examined using <a href="git-show">git-show[1]</a> with the &lt;revision&gt;:&lt;path&gt; syntax. This can sometimes be useful for browsing the contents of a tree that is not currently checked out.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="trust">
Trust</h4>  <p>If you receive the SHA-1 name of a blob from one source, and its contents from another (possibly untrusted) source, you can still trust that those contents are correct as long as the SHA-1 name agrees. This is because the SHA-1 is designed so that it is infeasible to find different contents that produce the same hash.</p>   <p>Similarly, you need only trust the SHA-1 name of a top-level tree object to trust the contents of the entire directory that it refers to, and if you receive the SHA-1 name of a commit from a trusted source, then you can easily verify the entire history of commits reachable through parents of that commit, and all of those contents of the trees referred to by those commits.</p>   <p>So to introduce some real trust in the system, the only thing you need to do is to digitally sign just <code>one</code> special note, which includes the name of a top-level commit. Your digital signature shows others that you trust that commit, and the immutability of the history of commits tells others that they can trust the whole history.</p>   <p>In other words, you can easily validate a whole archive by just sending out a single email that tells the people the name (SHA-1 hash) of the top commit, and digitally sign that email using something like GPG/PGP.</p>   <p>To assist in this, Git also provides the tag object…​</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="tag-object">
Tag Object</h4>  <p>A tag object contains an object, object type, tag name, the name of the person ("tagger") who created the tag, and a message, which may contain a signature, as can be seen using <a href="git-cat-file">git-cat-file[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file tag v1.5.0

How Git stores objects efficiently: pack files</h4>  <p>Newly created objects are initially created in a file named after the object’s SHA-1 hash (stored in <code>.git/objects</code>).</p>   <p>Unfortunately this system becomes inefficient once a project has a lot of objects. Try this on an old project:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git count-objects
6930 objects, 47620 kilobytes</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The first number is the number of objects which are kept in individual files. The second is the amount of space taken up by those "loose" objects.</p>   <p>You can save space and make Git faster by moving these loose objects in to a "pack file", which stores a group of objects in an efficient compressed format; the details of how pack files are formatted can be found in <a href="gitformat-pack">gitformat-pack[5]</a>.</p>   <p>To put the loose objects into a pack, just run git repack:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git repack
Counting objects: 6020, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6020/6020), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6020/6020), done.
Total 6020 (delta 4070), reused 0 (delta 0)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This creates a single "pack file" in .git/objects/pack/ containing all currently unpacked objects. You can then run</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git prune</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to remove any of the "loose" objects that are now contained in the pack. This will also remove any unreferenced objects (which may be created when, for example, you use <code>git reset</code> to remove a commit). You can verify that the loose objects are gone by looking at the <code>.git/objects</code> directory or by running</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git count-objects
0 objects, 0 kilobytes</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Although the object files are gone, any commands that refer to those objects will work exactly as they did before.</p>   <p>The <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a> command performs packing, pruning, and more for you, so is normally the only high-level command you need.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="dangling-objects">
Dangling objects</h4>  <p>The <a href="git-fsck">git-fsck[1]</a> command will sometimes complain about dangling objects. They are not a problem.</p>   <p>The most common cause of dangling objects is that you’ve rebased a branch, or you have pulled from somebody else who rebased a branch—​see <a href="#cleaning-up-history">Rewriting history and maintaining patch series</a>. In that case, the old head of the original branch still exists, as does everything it pointed to. The branch pointer itself just doesn’t, since you replaced it with another one.</p>   <p>There are also other situations that cause dangling objects. For example, a "dangling blob" may arise because you did a <code>git add</code> of a file, but then, before you actually committed it and made it part of the bigger picture, you changed something else in that file and committed that <strong>updated</strong> thing—​the old state that you added originally ends up not being pointed to by any commit or tree, so it’s now a dangling blob object.</p>   <p>Similarly, when the "ort" merge strategy runs, and finds that there are criss-cross merges and thus more than one merge base (which is fairly unusual, but it does happen), it will generate one temporary midway tree (or possibly even more, if you had lots of criss-crossing merges and more than two merge bases) as a temporary internal merge base, and again, those are real objects, but the end result will not end up pointing to them, so they end up "dangling" in your repository.</p>   <p>Generally, dangling objects aren’t anything to worry about. They can even be very useful: if you screw something up, the dangling objects can be how you recover your old tree (say, you did a rebase, and realized that you really didn’t want to—​you can look at what dangling objects you have, and decide to reset your head to some old dangling state).</p>   <p>For commits, you can just use:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ gitk &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt; --not --all</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This asks for all the history reachable from the given commit but not from any branch, tag, or other reference. If you decide it’s something you want, you can always create a new reference to it, e.g.,</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git branch recovered-branch &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For blobs and trees, you can’t do the same, but you can still examine them. You can just do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show &lt;dangling-blob/tree-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to show what the contents of the blob were (or, for a tree, basically what the <code>ls</code> for that directory was), and that may give you some idea of what the operation was that left that dangling object.</p>   <p>Usually, dangling blobs and trees aren’t very interesting. They’re almost always the result of either being a half-way mergebase (the blob will often even have the conflict markers from a merge in it, if you have had conflicting merges that you fixed up by hand), or simply because you interrupted a <code>git fetch</code> with ^C or something like that, leaving <code>some</code> of the new objects in the object database, but just dangling and useless.</p>   <p>Anyway, once you are sure that you’re not interested in any dangling state, you can just prune all unreachable objects:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git prune</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and they’ll be gone. (You should only run <code>git prune</code> on a quiescent repository—​it’s kind of like doing a filesystem fsck recovery: you don’t want to do that while the filesystem is mounted. <code>git prune</code> is designed not to cause any harm in such cases of concurrent accesses to a repository but you might receive confusing or scary messages.)</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="recovering-from-repository-corruption">
Recovering from repository corruption</h4>  <p>By design, Git treats data trusted to it with caution. However, even in the absence of bugs in Git itself, it is still possible that hardware or operating system errors could corrupt data.</p>   <p>The first defense against such problems is backups. You can back up a Git directory using clone, or just using cp, tar, or any other backup mechanism.</p>   <p>As a last resort, you can search for the corrupted objects and attempt to replace them by hand. Back up your repository before attempting this in case you corrupt things even more in the process.</p>   <p>We’ll assume that the problem is a single missing or corrupted blob, which is sometimes a solvable problem. (Recovering missing trees and especially commits is <strong>much</strong> harder).</p>   <p>Before starting, verify that there is corruption, and figure out where it is with <a href="git-fsck">git-fsck[1]</a>; this may be time-consuming.</p>   <p>Assume the output looks like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fsck --full --no-dangling
broken link from    tree 2d9263c6d23595e7cb2a21e5ebbb53655278dff8
              to    blob 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200
missing blob 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Now you know that blob 4b9458b3 is missing, and that the tree 2d9263c6 points to it. If you could find just one copy of that missing blob object, possibly in some other repository, you could move it into <code>.git/objects/4b/9458b3...</code> and be done. Suppose you can’t. You can still examine the tree that pointed to it with <a href="git-ls-tree">git-ls-tree[1]</a>, which might output something like:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git ls-tree 2d9263c6d23595e7cb2a21e5ebbb53655278dff8

...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>So now you know that the missing blob was the data for a file named <code>myfile</code>. And chances are you can also identify the directory—​let’s say it’s in <code>somedirectory</code>. If you’re lucky the missing copy might be the same as the copy you have checked out in your working tree at <code>somedirectory/myfile</code>; you can test whether that’s right with <a href="git-hash-object">git-hash-object[1]</a>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git hash-object -w somedirectory/myfile</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will create and store a blob object with the contents of somedirectory/myfile, and output the SHA-1 of that object. if you’re extremely lucky it might be 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200, in which case you’ve guessed right, and the corruption is fixed!</p>   <p>Otherwise, you need more information. How do you tell which version of the file has been lost?</p>   <p>The easiest way to do this is with:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log --raw --all --full-history -- somedirectory/myfile</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Because you’re asking for raw output, you’ll now get something like</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>commit abc

It has three important properties:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>The index contains all the information necessary to generate a single (uniquely determined) tree object.</p>  <p>For example, running <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> generates this tree object from the index, stores it in the object database, and uses it as the tree object associated with the new commit.</p>  </li> <li> <p>The index enables fast comparisons between the tree object it defines and the working tree.</p>  <p>It does this by storing some additional data for each entry (such as the last modified time). This data is not displayed above, and is not stored in the created tree object, but it can be used to determine quickly which files in the working directory differ from what was stored in the index, and thus save Git from having to read all of the data from such files to look for changes.</p>  </li> <li> <p>It can efficiently represent information about merge conflicts between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that you can create a three-way merge between them.</p>  <p>We saw in <a href="#conflict-resolution">Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</a> that during a merge the index can store multiple versions of a single file (called "stages"). The third column in the <a href="git-ls-files">git-ls-files[1]</a> output above is the stage number, and will take on values other than 0 for files with merge conflicts.</p>  </li> </ol> </div>  <p>The index is thus a sort of temporary staging area, which is filled with a tree which you are in the process of working on.</p>   <p>If you blow the index away entirely, you generally haven’t lost any information as long as you have the name of the tree that it described.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="submodules">Submodules</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Large projects are often composed of smaller, self-contained modules. For example, an embedded Linux distribution’s source tree would include every piece of software in the distribution with some local modifications; a movie player might need to build against a specific, known-working version of a decompression library; several independent programs might all share the same build scripts.</p>   <p>With centralized revision control systems this is often accomplished by including every module in one single repository. Developers can check out all modules or only the modules they need to work with. They can even modify files across several modules in a single commit while moving things around or updating APIs and translations.</p>   <p>Git does not allow partial checkouts, so duplicating this approach in Git would force developers to keep a local copy of modules they are not interested in touching. Commits in an enormous checkout would be slower than you’d expect as Git would have to scan every directory for changes. If modules have a lot of local history, clones would take forever.</p>   <p>On the plus side, distributed revision control systems can much better integrate with external sources. In a centralized model, a single arbitrary snapshot of the external project is exported from its own revision control and then imported into the local revision control on a vendor branch. All the history is hidden. With distributed revision control you can clone the entire external history and much more easily follow development and re-merge local changes.</p>   <p>Git’s submodule support allows a repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a checkout of an external project. Submodules maintain their own identity; the submodule support just stores the submodule repository location and commit ID, so other developers who clone the containing project ("superproject") can easily clone all the submodules at the same revision. Partial checkouts of the superproject are possible: you can tell Git to clone none, some or all of the submodules.</p>   <p>The <a href="git-submodule">git-submodule[1]</a> command is available since Git 1.5.3. Users with Git 1.5.2 can look up the submodule commits in the repository and manually check them out; earlier versions won’t recognize the submodules at all.</p>   <p>To see how submodule support works, create four example repositories that can be used later as a submodule:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mkdir ~/git

The Workflow</h3>  <p>High-level operations such as <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> and <a href="git-restore">git-restore[1]</a> work by moving data between the working tree, the index, and the object database. Git provides low-level operations which perform each of these steps individually.</p>   <p>Generally, all Git operations work on the index file. Some operations work <strong>purely</strong> on the index file (showing the current state of the index), but most operations move data between the index file and either the database or the working directory. Thus there are four main combinations:</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="working-directory-to-index">
working directory → index</h4>  <p>The <a href="git-update-index">git-update-index[1]</a> command updates the index with information from the working directory. You generally update the index information by just specifying the filename you want to update, like so:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git update-index filename</pre> </div> </div>  <p>but to avoid common mistakes with filename globbing etc., the command will not normally add totally new entries or remove old entries, i.e. it will normally just update existing cache entries.</p>   <p>To tell Git that yes, you really do realize that certain files no longer exist, or that new files should be added, you should use the <code>--remove</code> and <code>--add</code> flags respectively.</p>   <p>NOTE! A <code>--remove</code> flag does <code>not</code> mean that subsequent filenames will necessarily be removed: if the files still exist in your directory structure, the index will be updated with their new status, not removed. The only thing <code>--remove</code> means is that update-index will be considering a removed file to be a valid thing, and if the file really does not exist any more, it will update the index accordingly.</p>   <p>As a special case, you can also do <code>git update-index --refresh</code>, which will refresh the "stat" information of each index to match the current stat information. It will <code>not</code> update the object status itself, and it will only update the fields that are used to quickly test whether an object still matches its old backing store object.</p>   <p>The previously introduced <a href="git-add">git-add[1]</a> is just a wrapper for <a href="git-update-index">git-update-index[1]</a>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="index-to-object-database">
index → object database</h4>  <p>You write your current index file to a "tree" object with the program</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git write-tree</pre> </div> </div>  <p>that doesn’t come with any options—​it will just write out the current index into the set of tree objects that describe that state, and it will return the name of the resulting top-level tree. You can use that tree to re-generate the index at any time by going in the other direction:</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="object-database-to-index">
object database → index</h4>  <p>You read a "tree" file from the object database, and use that to populate (and overwrite—​don’t do this if your index contains any unsaved state that you might want to restore later!) your current index. Normal operation is just</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree &lt;SHA-1 of tree&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and your index file will now be equivalent to the tree that you saved earlier. However, that is only your <code>index</code> file: your working directory contents have not been modified.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="index-to-working-directory">
index → working directory</h4>  <p>You update your working directory from the index by "checking out" files. This is not a very common operation, since normally you’d just keep your files updated, and rather than write to your working directory, you’d tell the index files about the changes in your working directory (i.e. <code>git update-index</code>).</p>   <p>However, if you decide to jump to a new version, or check out somebody else’s version, or just restore a previous tree, you’d populate your index file with read-tree, and then you need to check out the result with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git checkout-index filename</pre> </div> </div>  <p>or, if you want to check out all of the index, use <code>-a</code>.</p>   <p>NOTE! <code>git checkout-index</code> normally refuses to overwrite old files, so if you have an old version of the tree already checked out, you will need to use the <code>-f</code> flag (<code>before</code> the <code>-a</code> flag or the filename) to <code>force</code> the checkout.</p>   <p>Finally, there are a few odds and ends which are not purely moving from one representation to the other:</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="tying-it-all-together">
Tying it all together</h4>  <p>To commit a tree you have instantiated with <code>git write-tree</code>, you’d create a "commit" object that refers to that tree and the history behind it—​most notably the "parent" commits that preceded it in history.</p>   <p>Normally a "commit" has one parent: the previous state of the tree before a certain change was made. However, sometimes it can have two or more parent commits, in which case we call it a "merge", due to the fact that such a commit brings together ("merges") two or more previous states represented by other commits.</p>   <p>In other words, while a "tree" represents a particular directory state of a working directory, a "commit" represents that state in time, and explains how we got there.</p>   <p>You create a commit object by giving it the tree that describes the state at the time of the commit, and a list of parents:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit-tree &lt;tree&gt; -p &lt;parent&gt; [(-p &lt;parent2&gt;)...]</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and then giving the reason for the commit on stdin (either through redirection from a pipe or file, or by just typing it at the tty).</p>   <p><code>git commit-tree</code> will return the name of the object that represents that commit, and you should save it away for later use. Normally, you’d commit a new <code>HEAD</code> state, and while Git doesn’t care where you save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the result to the file pointed at by <code>.git/HEAD</code>, so that we can always see what the last committed state was.</p>   <p>Here is a picture that illustrates how various pieces fit together:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                     commit-tree

Examining the data</h3>  <p>You can examine the data represented in the object database and the index with various helper tools. For every object, you can use <a href="git-cat-file">git-cat-file[1]</a> to examine details about the object:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file -t &lt;objectname&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>shows the type of the object, and once you have the type (which is usually implicit in where you find the object), you can use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file blob|tree|commit|tag &lt;objectname&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to show its contents. NOTE! Trees have binary content, and as a result there is a special helper for showing that content, called <code>git ls-tree</code>, which turns the binary content into a more easily readable form.</p>   <p>It’s especially instructive to look at "commit" objects, since those tend to be small and fairly self-explanatory. In particular, if you follow the convention of having the top commit name in <code>.git/HEAD</code>, you can do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file commit HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to see what the top commit was.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="merging-multiple-trees">
Merging multiple trees</h3>  <p>Git can help you perform a three-way merge, which can in turn be used for a many-way merge by repeating the merge procedure several times. The usual situation is that you only do one three-way merge (reconciling two lines of history) and commit the result, but if you like to, you can merge several branches in one go.</p>   <p>To perform a three-way merge, you start with the two commits you want to merge, find their closest common parent (a third commit), and compare the trees corresponding to these three commits.</p>   <p>To get the "base" for the merge, look up the common parent of two commits:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge-base &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This prints the name of a commit they are both based on. You should now look up the tree objects of those commits, which you can easily do with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file commit &lt;commitname&gt; | head -1</pre> </div> </div>  <p>since the tree object information is always the first line in a commit object.</p>   <p>Once you know the three trees you are going to merge (the one "original" tree, aka the common tree, and the two "result" trees, aka the branches you want to merge), you do a "merge" read into the index. This will complain if it has to throw away your old index contents, so you should make sure that you’ve committed those—​in fact you would normally always do a merge against your last commit (which should thus match what you have in your current index anyway).</p>   <p>To do the merge, do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree -m -u &lt;origtree&gt; &lt;yourtree&gt; &lt;targettree&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will do all trivial merge operations for you directly in the index file, and you can just write the result out with <code>git write-tree</code>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="merging-multiple-trees-2">
Merging multiple trees, continued</h3>  <p>Sadly, many merges aren’t trivial. If there are files that have been added, moved or removed, or if both branches have modified the same file, you will be left with an index tree that contains "merge entries" in it. Such an index tree can <code>NOT</code> be written out to a tree object, and you will have to resolve any such merge clashes using other tools before you can write out the result.</p>   <p>You can examine such index state with <code>git ls-files --unmerged</code> command. An example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree -m $orig HEAD $target
$ git ls-files --unmerged
100644 263414f423d0e4d70dae8fe53fa34614ff3e2860 1        hello.c
100644 06fa6a24256dc7e560efa5687fa84b51f0263c3a 2        hello.c
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3        hello.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Each line of the <code>git ls-files --unmerged</code> output begins with the blob mode bits, blob SHA-1, <code>stage number</code>, and the filename. The <code>stage number</code> is Git’s way to say which tree it came from: stage 1 corresponds to the <code>$orig</code> tree, stage 2 to the <code>HEAD</code> tree, and stage 3 to the <code>$target</code> tree.</p>   <p>Earlier we said that trivial merges are done inside <code>git read-tree -m</code>. For example, if the file did not change from <code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> or <code>$target</code>, or if the file changed from <code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> and <code>$orig</code> to <code>$target</code> the same way, obviously the final outcome is what is in <code>HEAD</code>. What the above example shows is that file <code>hello.c</code> was changed from <code>$orig</code> to <code>HEAD</code> and <code>$orig</code> to <code>$target</code> in a different way. You could resolve this by running your favorite 3-way merge program, e.g. <code>diff3</code>, <code>merge</code>, or Git’s own merge-file, on the blob objects from these three stages yourself, like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file blob 263414f &gt;hello.c~1
$ git cat-file blob 06fa6a2 &gt;hello.c~2
$ git cat-file blob cc44c73 &gt;hello.c~3
$ git merge-file hello.c~2 hello.c~1 hello.c~3</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This would leave the merge result in <code>hello.c~2</code> file, along with conflict markers if there are conflicts. After verifying the merge result makes sense, you can tell Git what the final merge result for this file is by:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mv -f hello.c~2 hello.c
$ git update-index hello.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>When a path is in the "unmerged" state, running <code>git update-index</code> for that path tells Git to mark the path resolved.</p>   <p>The above is the description of a Git merge at the lowest level, to help you understand what conceptually happens under the hood. In practice, nobody, not even Git itself, runs <code>git cat-file</code> three times for this. There is a <code>git merge-index</code> program that extracts the stages to temporary files and calls a "merge" script on it:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and that is what higher level <code>git merge -s resolve</code> is implemented with.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="hacking-git">Hacking git</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>This chapter covers internal details of the Git implementation which probably only Git developers need to understand.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="object-details">
Object storage format</h3>  <p>All objects have a statically determined "type" which identifies the format of the object (i.e. how it is used, and how it can refer to other objects). There are currently four different object types: "blob", "tree", "commit", and "tag".</p>   <p>Regardless of object type, all objects share the following characteristics: they are all deflated with zlib, and have a header that not only specifies their type, but also provides size information about the data in the object. It’s worth noting that the SHA-1 hash that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data plus this header, so <code>sha1sum</code> <code>file</code> does not match the object name for <code>file</code>.</p>   <p>As a result, the general consistency of an object can always be tested independently of the contents or the type of the object: all objects can be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that forms a sequence of <code>&lt;ascii type without space&gt; + &lt;space&gt; + &lt;ascii decimal size&gt; +
&lt;byte\0&gt; + &lt;binary object data&gt;</code>.</p>   <p>The structured objects can further have their structure and connectivity to other objects verified. This is generally done with the <code>git fsck</code> program, which generates a full dependency graph of all objects, and verifies their internal consistency (in addition to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash).</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="birdview-on-the-source-code">
A birds-eye view of Git’s source code</h3>  <p>It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Git’s source code. This section gives you a little guidance to show where to start.</p>   <p>A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit, with:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch --detach e83c5163</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything Git has today, but is small enough to read in one sitting.</p>   <p>Note that terminology has changed since that revision. For example, the README in that revision uses the word "changeset" to describe what we now call a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit</a>.</p>   <p>Also, we do not call it "cache" any more, but rather "index"; however, the file is still called <code>read-cache.h</code>.</p>   <p>If you grasp the ideas in that initial commit, you should check out a more recent version and skim <code>read-cache-ll.h</code>, <code>object.h</code> and <code>commit.h</code>.</p>   <p>In the early days, Git (in the tradition of UNIX) was a bunch of programs which were extremely simple, and which you used in scripts, piping the output of one into another. This turned out to be good for initial development, since it was easier to test new things. However, recently many of these parts have become builtins, and some of the core has been "libified", i.e. put into libgit.a for performance, portability reasons, and to avoid code duplication.</p>   <p>By now, you know what the index is (and find the corresponding data structures in <code>read-cache-ll.h</code>), and that there are just a couple of object types (blobs, trees, commits and tags) which inherit their common structure from <code>struct object</code>, which is their first member (and thus, you can cast e.g. <code>(struct object *)commit</code> to achieve the <code>same</code> as <code>&amp;commit-&gt;object</code>, i.e. get at the object name and flags).</p>   <p>Now is a good point to take a break to let this information sink in.</p>   <p>Next step: get familiar with the object naming. Read <a href="#naming-commits">Naming commits</a>. There are quite a few ways to name an object (and not only revisions!). All of these are handled in <code>sha1_name.c</code>. Just have a quick look at the function <code>get_sha1()</code>. A lot of the special handling is done by functions like <code>get_sha1_basic()</code> or the likes.</p>   <p>This is just to get you into the groove for the most libified part of Git: the revision walker.</p>   <p>Basically, the initial version of <code>git log</code> was a shell script:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git-rev-list --pretty $(git-rev-parse --default HEAD "$@") | \
        LESS=-S ${PAGER:-less}</pre> </div> </div>  <p>What does this mean?</p>   <p><code>git rev-list</code> is the original version of the revision walker, which <code>always</code> printed a list of revisions to stdout. It is still functional, and needs to, since most new Git commands start out as scripts using <code>git rev-list</code>.</p>   <p><code>git rev-parse</code> is not as important any more; it was only used to filter out options that were relevant for the different plumbing commands that were called by the script.</p>   <p>Most of what <code>git rev-list</code> did is contained in <code>revision.c</code> and <code>revision.h</code>. It wraps the options in a struct named <code>rev_info</code>, which controls how and what revisions are walked, and more.</p>   <p>The original job of <code>git rev-parse</code> is now taken by the function <code>setup_revisions()</code>, which parses the revisions and the common command-line options for the revision walker. This information is stored in the struct <code>rev_info</code> for later consumption. You can do your own command-line option parsing after calling <code>setup_revisions()</code>. After that, you have to call <code>prepare_revision_walk()</code> for initialization, and then you can get the commits one by one with the function <code>get_revision()</code>.</p>   <p>If you are interested in more details of the revision walking process, just have a look at the first implementation of <code>cmd_log()</code>; call <code>git show v1.3.0~155^2~4</code> and scroll down to that function (note that you no longer need to call <code>setup_pager()</code> directly).</p>   <p>Nowadays, <code>git log</code> is a builtin, which means that it is <code>contained</code> in the command <code>git</code>. The source side of a builtin is</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>a function called <code>cmd_&lt;bla&gt;</code>, typically defined in <code>builtin/&lt;bla.c&gt;</code> (note that older versions of Git used to have it in <code>builtin-&lt;bla&gt;.c</code> instead), and declared in <code>builtin.h</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>an entry in the <code>commands[]</code> array in <code>git.c</code>, and</p> </li> <li> <p>an entry in <code>BUILTIN_OBJECTS</code> in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Sometimes, more than one builtin is contained in one source file. For example, <code>cmd_whatchanged()</code> and <code>cmd_log()</code> both reside in <code>builtin/log.c</code>, since they share quite a bit of code. In that case, the commands which are <code>not</code> named like the <code>.c</code> file in which they live have to be listed in <code>BUILT_INS</code> in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>   <p><code>git log</code> looks more complicated in C than it does in the original script, but that allows for a much greater flexibility and performance.</p>   <p>Here again it is a good point to take a pause.</p>   <p>Lesson three is: study the code. Really, it is the best way to learn about the organization of Git (after you know the basic concepts).</p>   <p>So, think about something which you are interested in, say, "how can I access a blob just knowing the object name of it?". The first step is to find a Git command with which you can do it. In this example, it is either <code>git show</code> or <code>git cat-file</code>.</p>   <p>For the sake of clarity, let’s stay with <code>git cat-file</code>, because it</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>is plumbing, and</p> </li> <li> <p>was around even in the initial commit (it literally went only through some 20 revisions as <code>cat-file.c</code>, was renamed to <code>builtin/cat-file.c</code> when made a builtin, and then saw less than 10 versions).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>So, look into <code>builtin/cat-file.c</code>, search for <code>cmd_cat_file()</code> and look what it does.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        git_config(git_default_config);
        if (argc != 3)
                usage("git cat-file [-t|-s|-e|-p|&lt;type&gt;] &lt;sha1&gt;");
        if (get_sha1(argv[2], sha1))
                die("Not a valid object name %s", argv[2]);</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Let’s skip over the obvious details; the only really interesting part here is the call to <code>get_sha1()</code>. It tries to interpret <code>argv[2]</code> as an object name, and if it refers to an object which is present in the current repository, it writes the resulting SHA-1 into the variable <code>sha1</code>.</p>   <p>Two things are interesting here:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p><code>get_sha1()</code> returns 0 on <code>success</code>. This might surprise some new Git hackers, but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different negative numbers in case of different errors—​and 0 on success.</p> </li> <li> <p>the variable <code>sha1</code> in the function signature of <code>get_sha1()</code> is <code>unsigned
char *</code>, but is actually expected to be a pointer to <code>unsigned
char[20]</code>. This variable will contain the 160-bit SHA-1 of the given commit. Note that whenever a SHA-1 is passed as <code>unsigned char *</code>, it is the binary representation, as opposed to the ASCII representation in hex characters, which is passed as <code>char *</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>You will see both of these things throughout the code.</p>   <p>Now, for the meat:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        case 0:
                buf = read_object_with_reference(sha1, argv[1], &amp;size, NULL);</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is how you read a blob (actually, not only a blob, but any type of object). To know how the function <code>read_object_with_reference()</code> actually works, find the source code for it (something like <code>git grep
read_object_with | grep ":[a-z]"</code> in the Git repository), and read the source.</p>   <p>To find out how the result can be used, just read on in <code>cmd_cat_file()</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        write_or_die(1, buf, size);</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Sometimes, you do not know where to look for a feature. In many such cases, it helps to search through the output of <code>git log</code>, and then <code>git show</code> the corresponding commit.</p>   <p>Example: If you know that there was some test case for <code>git bundle</code>, but do not remember where it was (yes, you <code>could</code> <code>git grep bundle t/</code>, but that does not illustrate the point!):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log --no-merges t/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In the pager (<code>less</code>), just search for "bundle", go a few lines back, and see that it is in commit 18449ab0. Now just copy this object name, and paste it into the command line</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show 18449ab0</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Voila.</p>   <p>Another example: Find out what to do in order to make some script a builtin:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git log --no-merges --diff-filter=A builtin/*.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You see, Git is actually the best tool to find out about the source of Git itself!</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="glossary">Git glossary</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="git-explained">

Todo list</h3>  <p>This is a work in progress.</p>   <p>The basic requirements:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>It must be readable in order, from beginning to end, by someone intelligent with a basic grasp of the UNIX command line, but without any special knowledge of Git. If necessary, any other prerequisites should be specifically mentioned as they arise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whenever possible, section headings should clearly describe the task they explain how to do, in language that requires no more knowledge than necessary: for example, "importing patches into a project" rather than "the <code>git am</code> command"</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Think about how to create a clear chapter dependency graph that will allow people to get to important topics without necessarily reading everything in between.</p>   <p>Scan <code>Documentation/</code> for other stuff left out; in particular:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>howto’s</p> </li> <li> <p>some of <code>technical/</code>?</p> </li> <li> <p>hooks</p> </li> <li> <p>list of commands in <a href="git">git[1]</a></p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Scan email archives for other stuff left out</p>   <p>Scan man pages to see if any assume more background than this manual provides.</p>   <p>Add more good examples. Entire sections of just cookbook examples might be a good idea; maybe make an "advanced examples" section a standard end-of-chapter section?</p>   <p>Include cross-references to the glossary, where appropriate.</p>   <p>Add a section on working with other version control systems, including CVS, Subversion, and just imports of series of release tarballs.</p>   <p>Write a chapter on using plumbing and writing scripts.</p>   <p>Alternates, clone -reference, etc.</p>   <p>More on recovery from repository corruption.
