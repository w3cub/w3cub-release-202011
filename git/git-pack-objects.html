In a packed archive, an object is either stored as a compressed whole or as a difference from some other object. The latter is often called a delta.</p>   <p>The packed archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained so that it can be unpacked without any further information. Therefore, each object that a delta depends upon must be present within the pack.</p>   <p>A pack index file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the packed archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the directories on $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read from the pack archive.</p>   <p>The <code>git unpack-objects</code> command can read the packed archive and expand the objects contained in the pack into "one-file one-object" format; this is typically done by the smart-pull commands when a pack is created on-the-fly for efficient network transport by their peers.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-objects.txt-base-name"> base-name </dt> <dd> <p>Write into pairs of files (.pack and .idx), using &lt;base-name&gt; to determine the name of the created file.

This algorithm only walks trees that appear in paths that introduce new objects. This can have significant performance benefits when computing a pack to send a small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are added to the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of direct renames.

Use <code>git index-pack --fix-thin</code> (see <a href="git-index-pack">git-index-pack[1]</a>) to restore the self-contained property.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-objects.txt---shallow"> --shallow </dt> <dd> <p>Optimize a pack that will be provided to a client with a shallow repository.

By default, <code>git pack-objects</code> only uses the former format for better compatibility. This option allows the command to use the latter format for compactness. Depending on the average delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the resulting packfile by 3-5 per-cent.</p>  <p>Note: Porcelain commands such as <code>git gc</code> (see <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a>), <code>git repack</code> (see <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a>) pass this option by default in modern Git when they put objects in your repository into pack files. So does <code>git bundle</code> (see <a href="git-bundle">git-bundle[1]</a>) when it creates a bundle.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-objects.txt---threadsltngt"> --threads=&lt;n&gt; </dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best delta matches. This requires that pack-objects be compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPUâ€™s and set the number of threads accordingly.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-objects.txt---index-versionltversiongtltoffsetgt"> --index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;] </dt> <dd> <p>This is intended to be used by the test suite only.

See DELTA ISLANDS below.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_delta_islands">Delta islands</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>When possible, <code>pack-objects</code> tries to reuse existing on-disk deltas to avoid having to search for new ones on the fly. This is an important optimization for serving fetches, because it means the server can avoid inflating most objects at all and just send the bytes directly from disk. This optimization canâ€™t work when an object is stored as a delta against a base which the receiver does not have (and which we are not already sending). In that case the server "breaks" the delta and has to find a new one, which has a high CPU cost. Therefore itâ€™s important for performance that the set of objects in on-disk delta relationships match what a client would fetch.</p>   <p>In a normal repository, this tends to work automatically. The objects are mostly reachable from the branches and tags, and thatâ€™s what clients fetch. Any deltas we find on the server are likely to be between objects the client has or will have.</p>   <p>But in some repository setups, you may have several related but separate groups of ref tips, with clients tending to fetch those groups independently. For example, imagine that you are hosting several "forks" of a repository in a single shared object store, and letting clients view them as separate repositories through <code>GIT_NAMESPACE</code> or separate repos using the alternates mechanism. A naive repack may find that the optimal delta for an object is against a base that is only found in another fork. But when a client fetches, they will not have the base object, and weâ€™ll have to find a new delta on the fly.</p>   <p>A similar situation may exist if you have many refs outside of <code>refs/heads/</code> and <code>refs/tags/</code> that point to related objects (e.g., <code>refs/pull</code> or <code>refs/changes</code> used by some hosting providers). By default, clients fetch only heads and tags, and deltas against objects found only in those other groups cannot be sent as-is.</p>   <p>Delta islands solve this problem by allowing you to group your refs into distinct "islands". Pack-objects computes which objects are reachable from which islands, and refuses to make a delta from an object <code>A</code> against a base which is not present in all of <code>A</code>'s islands. This results in slightly larger packs (because we miss some delta opportunities), but guarantees that a fetch of one island will not have to recompute deltas on the fly due to crossing island boundaries.</p>   <p>When repacking with delta islands the delta window tends to get clogged with candidates that are forbidden by the config. Repacking with a big --window helps (and doesnâ€™t take as long as it otherwise might because we can reject some object pairs based on islands before doing any computation on the content).</p>   <p>Islands are configured via the <code>pack.island</code> option, which can be specified multiple times. Each value is a left-anchored regular expressions matching refnames. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[pack]
island = refs/heads/
island = refs/tags/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>puts heads and tags into an island (whose name is the empty string; see below for more on naming). Any refs which do not match those regular expressions (e.g., <code>refs/pull/123</code>) is not in any island. Any object which is reachable only from <code>refs/pull/</code> (but not heads or tags) is therefore not a candidate to be used as a base for <code>refs/heads/</code>.</p>   <p>Refs are grouped into islands based on their "names", and two regexes that produce the same name are considered to be in the same island. The names are computed from the regexes by concatenating any capture groups from the regex, with a <code>-</code> dash in between. (And if there are no capture groups, then the name is the empty string, as in the above example.) This allows you to create arbitrary numbers of islands. Only up to 14 such capture groups are supported though.</p>   <p>For example, imagine you store the refs for each fork in <code>refs/virtual/ID</code>, where <code>ID</code> is a numeric identifier. You might then configure:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[pack]
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/heads/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/tags/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/(pull)/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>That puts the heads and tags for each fork in their own island (named "1234" or similar), and the pull refs for each go into their own "1234-pull".</p>   <p>Note that we pick a single island for each regex to go into, using "last one wins" ordering (which allows repo-specific config to take precedence over user-wide config, and so forth).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_configuration">Configuration</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Various configuration variables affect packing, see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> (search for "pack" and "delta").</p>   <p>Notably, delta compression is not used on objects larger than the <code>core.bigFileThreshold</code> configuration variable and on files with the attribute <code>delta</code> set to false.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_see_also">See also</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p><a href="git-rev-list">git-rev-list[1]</a> <a href="git-repack">git-repack[1]</a> <a href="git-prune-packed">git-prune-packed[1]</a></p>  </div>
