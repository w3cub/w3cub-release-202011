git bisect help</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project’s history introduced a bug. You use it by first telling it a "bad" commit that is known to contain the bug, and a "good" commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced. Then <code>git
bisect</code> picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks you whether the selected commit is "good" or "bad". It continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact commit that introduced the change.</p>   <p>In fact, <code>git bisect</code> can be used to find the commit that changed <strong>any</strong> property of your project; e.g., the commit that fixed a bug, or the commit that caused a benchmark’s performance to improve. To support this more general usage, the terms "old" and "new" can be used in place of "good" and "bad", or you can choose your own terms. See section "Alternate terms" below for more information.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_basic_bisect_commands_start_bad_good">
Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good</h3>  <p>As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a feature that was known to work in version <code>v2.6.13-rc2</code> of your project. You start a bisect session as follows:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit, <code>git
bisect</code> selects a commit in the middle of that range of history, checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If that version works correctly, type</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect good</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If that version is broken, type</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect bad</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then <code>git bisect</code> will respond with something like</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and depending on whether it is good or bad run <code>git bisect good</code> or <code>git bisect bad</code> to ask for the next commit that needs testing.</p>   <p>Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and the command will print out a description of the first bad commit. The reference <code>refs/bisect/bad</code> will be left pointing at that commit.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_bisect_reset">
Bisect reset</h3>  <p>After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and return to the original HEAD, issue the following command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect reset</pre> </div> </div>  <p>By default, this will return your tree to the commit that was checked out before <code>git bisect start</code>. (A new <code>git bisect start</code> will also do that, as it cleans up the old bisection state.)</p>   <p>With an optional argument, you can return to a different commit instead:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For example, <code>git bisect reset bisect/bad</code> will check out the first bad revision, while <code>git bisect reset HEAD</code> will leave you on the current bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_alternate_terms">
Alternate terms</h3>  <p>Sometimes you are not looking for the commit that introduced a breakage, but rather for a commit that caused a change between some other "old" state and "new" state. For example, you might be looking for the commit that introduced a particular fix. Or you might be looking for the first commit in which the source-code filenames were finally all converted to your company’s naming standard. Or whatever.</p>   <p>In such cases it can be very confusing to use the terms "good" and "bad" to refer to "the state before the change" and "the state after the change". So instead, you can use the terms "old" and "new", respectively, in place of "good" and "bad". (But note that you cannot mix "good" and "bad" with "old" and "new" in a single session.)</p>   <p>In this more general usage, you provide <code>git bisect</code> with a "new" commit that has some property and an "old" commit that doesn’t have that property. Each time <code>git bisect</code> checks out a commit, you test if that commit has the property. If it does, mark the commit as "new"; otherwise, mark it as "old". When the bisection is done, <code>git bisect</code> will report which commit introduced the property.</p>   <p>To use "old" and "new" instead of "good" and bad, you must run <code>git
bisect start</code> without commits as argument and then run the following commands to add the commits:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect old [&lt;rev&gt;]</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to indicate that a commit was before the sought change, or</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect new [&lt;rev&gt;...]</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to indicate that it was after.</p>   <p>To get a reminder of the currently used terms, use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect terms</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can get just the old (respectively new) term with <code>git bisect terms
--term-old</code> or <code>git bisect terms --term-good</code>.</p>   <p>If you would like to use your own terms instead of "bad"/"good" or "new"/"old", you can choose any names you like (except existing bisect subcommands like <code>reset</code>, <code>start</code>, …​) by starting the bisection using</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect start --term-old &lt;term-old&gt; --term-new &lt;term-new&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For example, if you are looking for a commit that introduced a performance regression, you might use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect start --term-old fast --term-new slow</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Or if you are looking for the commit that fixed a bug, you might use</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git bisect start --term-new fixed --term-old broken</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then, use <code>git bisect &lt;term-old&gt;</code> and <code>git bisect &lt;term-new&gt;</code> instead of <code>git bisect good</code> and <code>git bisect bad</code> to mark commits.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_bisect_visualizeview">
Bisect visualize/view</h3>  <p>To see the currently remaining suspects in <code>gitk</code>, issue the following command during the bisection process (the subcommand <code>view</code> can be used as an alternative to <code>visualize</code>):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect visualize</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If the <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable is not set, <code>git log</code> is used instead. You can also give command-line options such as <code>-p</code> and <code>--stat</code>.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect visualize --stat</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_bisect_log_and_bisect_replay">
Bisect log and bisect replay</h3>  <p>After having marked revisions as good or bad, issue the following command to show what has been done so far:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect log</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status of a revision, you can save the output of this command to a file, edit it to remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the following commands to return to a corrected state:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect reset
$ git bisect replay that-file</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_avoiding_testing_a_commit">
Avoiding testing a commit</h3>  <p>If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the suggested revision is not a good one to test (e.g. it fails to build and you know that the failure does not have anything to do with the bug you are chasing), you can manually select a nearby commit and test that one instead.</p>   <p>For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect good/bad                        # previous round was good or bad.
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
$ git bisect visualize                        # oops, that is uninteresting.
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3                # try 3 revisions before what
                                        # was suggested</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then compile and test the chosen revision, and afterwards mark the revision as good or bad in the usual manner.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_bisect_skip">
Bisect skip</h3>  <p>Instead of choosing a nearby commit by yourself, you can ask Git to do it for you by issuing the command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect skip                 # Current version cannot be tested</pre> </div> </div>  <p>However, if you skip a commit adjacent to the one you are looking for, Git will be unable to tell exactly which of those commits was the first bad one.</p>   <p>You can also skip a range of commits, instead of just one commit, using range notation. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This tells the bisect process that no commit after <code>v2.5</code>, up to and including <code>v2.6</code>, should be tested.</p>   <p>Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of the range you would issue the command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect skip v2.5 v2.5..v2.6</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This tells the bisect process that the commits between <code>v2.5</code> and <code>v2.6</code> (inclusive) should be skipped.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_cutting_down_bisection_by_giving_more_parameters_to_bisect_start">
Cutting down bisection by giving more parameters to bisect start</h3>  <p>You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know what part of the tree is involved in the problem you are tracking down, by specifying path parameters when issuing the <code>bisect start</code> command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect start -- arch/i386 include/asm-i386</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you can narrow the bisect space down by specifying all of the good commits immediately after the bad commit when issuing the <code>bisect start</code> command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6 v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1 --
                   # v2.6.20-rc6 is bad
                   # v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are good</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_bisect_run">
Bisect run</h3>  <p>If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is good or bad, you can bisect by issuing the command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect run my_script arguments</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note that the script (<code>my_script</code> in the above example) should exit with code 0 if the current source code is good/old, and exit with a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source code is bad/new.</p>   <p>Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It should be noted that a program that terminates via <code>exit(-1)</code> leaves $? = 255, (see the exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with <code>&amp; 0377</code>.</p>   <p>The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current revision will be skipped (see <code>git bisect skip</code> above). 125 was chosen as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose, because 126 and 127 are used by POSIX shells to signal specific error status (127 is for command not found, 126 is for command found but not executable—​these details do not matter, as they are normal errors in the script, as far as <code>bisect run</code> is concerned).</p>   <p>You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header file, or "revision that does not have this commit needs this patch applied to work around another problem this bisection is not interested in") applied to the revision being tested.</p>   <p>To cope with such a situation, after the inner <code>git bisect</code> finds the next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before compiling, run the real test, and afterwards decide if the revision (possibly with the needed patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to the pristine state. Finally the script should exit with the status of the real test to let the <code>git bisect run</code> command loop determine the eventual outcome of the bisect session.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bisect.txt---no-checkout"> --no-checkout </dt> <dd>  <p>Do not checkout the new working tree at each iteration of the bisection process. Instead just update a special reference named <code>BISECT_HEAD</code> to make it point to the commit that should be tested.</p>   <p>This option may be useful when the test you would perform in each step does not require a checked out tree.</p>   <p>If the repository is bare, <code>--no-checkout</code> is assumed.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bisect.txt---first-parent"> --first-parent </dt> <dd>  <p>Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit.</p>   <p>In detecting regressions introduced through the merging of a branch, the merge commit will be identified as introduction of the bug and its ancestors will be ignored.</p>   <p>This option is particularly useful in avoiding false positives when a merged branch contained broken or non-buildable commits, but the merge itself was OK.</p>  </dd> </dl> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_examples">Examples</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically bisect a broken build between v1.2 and HEAD:</p> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bisect start HEAD v1.2 --      # HEAD is bad, v1.2 is good

In this script, if <code>make</code> fails, we skip the current commit. <code>check_test_case.sh</code> should <code>exit 0</code> if the test case passes, and <code>exit 1</code> otherwise.</p>   <p>It is safer if both <code>test.sh</code> and <code>check_test_case.sh</code> are outside the repository to prevent interactions between the bisect, make and test processes and the scripts.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Automatically bisect with temporary modifications (hot-fix):</p> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ cat ~/test.sh
