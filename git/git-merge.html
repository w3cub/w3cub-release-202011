This command is used by <code>git pull</code> to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.</p>   <p>Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "<code>master</code>":</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then "<code>git merge topic</code>" will replay the changes made on the <code>topic</code> branch since it diverged from <code>master</code> (i.e., <code>E</code>) until its current commit (<code>C</code>) on top of <code>master</code>, and record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes. Before the operation, <code>ORIG_HEAD</code> is set to the tip of the current branch (<code>C</code>).</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>          A---B---C topic
         /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The second syntax ("<code>git merge --abort</code>") can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <code>git merge --abort</code> will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes were further modified after the merge was started), <code>git merge --abort</code> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p>   <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Running <code>git merge</code> with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</p>   <p>The third syntax ("<code>git merge --continue</code>") can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-merge.txt---commit"> --commit </dt> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-merge.txt---no-commit"> --no-commit </dt> <dd> <p>Perform the merge and commit the result.

The <code>--edit</code> (or <code>-e</code>) option is still useful if you are giving a draft message with the <code>-m</code> option from the command line and want to edit it in the editor.</p>  <p>Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log message.

(Special narrow exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge strategy is in use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)</p>   <p>If all named commits are already ancestors of <code>HEAD</code>, <code>git merge</code> will exit early with the message "Already up to date."</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_fast_forward_merge">Fast-forward merge</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This is the most common case especially when invoked from <code>git pull</code>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is not needed to store the combined history; instead, the <code>HEAD</code> (along with the index) is updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra merge commit.</p>   <p>This behavior can be suppressed with the <code>--no-ff</code> option.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_true_merge">True merge</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its parents.</p>   <p>A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be merged is committed, and your <code>HEAD</code>, index, and working tree are updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</p>   <p>When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following happens:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>The <code>HEAD</code> pointer stays the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> ref is set to point to the other branch head.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.</p> </li> <li> <p>For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2 from <code>HEAD</code>, and stage 3 from <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> (you can inspect the stages with <code>git ls-files -u</code>). The working tree files contain the result of the merge operation; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar conflict markers <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> <code>===</code> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A special ref <code>AUTO_MERGE</code> is written, pointing to a tree corresponding to the current content of the working tree (including conflict markers for textual conflicts). Note that this ref is only written when the <code>ort</code> merge strategy is used (the default).</p> </li> <li> <p>No other changes are made. In particular, the local modifications you had before you started merge will stay the same and the index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <code>HEAD</code>.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to start over, you can recover with <code>git merge --abort</code>.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_merging_tag">Merging tag</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the commit message template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the message template. See also <a href="git-tag">git-tag[1]</a>.</p>   <p>When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.</p>   <p>In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it to <code>git merge</code>, or pass <code>--ff-only</code> when you do not have any work on your own. e.g.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git fetch origin
git merge v1.2.3^0
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3</pre> </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_how_conflicts_are_presented">How conflicts are presented</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor’s version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.</p>   <p>By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge" program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The part before the <code>=======</code> is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</p>   <p>The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with Barbie’s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is that your side wants to say it is hard and you’d prefer to go shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.</p>   <p>An alternative style can be used by setting the "merge.conflictStyle" configuration variable to either "diff3" or "zdiff3".
