<h1>gitprotocol-pack</h1>  <h2 id="_name">Name</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>gitprotocol-pack - How packs are transferred over-the-wire</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_synopsis">Synopsis</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="verseblock"> <pre class="content">&lt;over-the-wire-protocol&gt;</pre> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_description">Description</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Git supports transferring data in packfiles over the ssh://, git://, http:// and file:// transports. There exist two sets of protocols, one for pushing data from a client to a server and another for fetching data from a server to a client. The three transports (ssh, git, file) use the same protocol to transfer data. http is documented in <a href="gitprotocol-http">gitprotocol-http[5]</a>.</p>   <p>The processes invoked in the canonical Git implementation are <code>upload-pack</code> on the server side and <code>fetch-pack</code> on the client side for fetching data; then <code>receive-pack</code> on the server and <code>send-pack</code> on the client for pushing data. The protocol functions to have a server tell a client what is currently on the server, then for the two to negotiate the smallest amount of data to send in order to fully update one or the other.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_pkt_line_format">Pkt-line format</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The descriptions below build on the pkt-line format described in <a href="gitprotocol-common">gitprotocol-common[5]</a>. When the grammar indicate <code>PKT-LINE(...)</code>, unless otherwise noted the usual pkt-line LF rules apply: the sender SHOULD include a LF, but the receiver MUST NOT complain if it is not present.</p>   <p>An error packet is a special pkt-line that contains an error string.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>  error-line     =  PKT-LINE("ERR" SP explanation-text)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Throughout the protocol, where <code>PKT-LINE(...)</code> is expected, an error packet MAY be sent. Once this packet is sent by a client or a server, the data transfer process defined in this protocol is terminated.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_transports">Transports</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>There are three transports over which the packfile protocol is initiated. The Git transport is a simple, unauthenticated server that takes the command (almost always <code>upload-pack</code>, though Git servers can be configured to be globally writable, in which <code>receive- pack</code> initiation is also allowed) with which the client wishes to communicate and executes it and connects it to the requesting process.</p>   <p>In the SSH transport, the client just runs the <code>upload-pack</code> or <code>receive-pack</code> process on the server over the SSH protocol and then communicates with that invoked process over the SSH connection.</p>   <p>The file:// transport runs the <code>upload-pack</code> or <code>receive-pack</code> process locally and communicates with it over a pipe.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_extra_parameters">Extra parameters</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The protocol provides a mechanism in which clients can send additional information in its first message to the server. These are called "Extra Parameters", and are supported by the Git, SSH, and HTTP protocols.</p>   <p>Each Extra Parameter takes the form of <code>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;key&gt;</code>.</p>   <p>Servers that receive any such Extra Parameters MUST ignore all unrecognized keys. Currently, the only Extra Parameter recognized is "version" with a value of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>. See <a href="gitprotocol-v2">gitprotocol-v2[5]</a> for more information on protocol version 2.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_git_transport">Git transport</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The Git transport starts off by sending the command and repository on the wire using the pkt-line format, followed by a NUL byte and a hostname parameter, terminated by a NUL byte.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>0033git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The transport may send Extra Parameters by adding an additional NUL byte, and then adding one or more NUL-terminated strings:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=1\0</pre> </div> </div> <div class="openblock"> <div class="content"> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git-proto-request = request-command SP pathname NUL
      [ host-parameter NUL ] [ NUL extra-parameters ]

See --interpolated-path option to git daemon, with the %H/%CH format characters.</p>   <p>Basically what the Git client is doing to connect to an <code>upload-pack</code> process on the server side over the Git protocol is this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ echo -e -n \
  "003agit-upload-pack /schacon/gitbook.git\0host=example.com\0" |

It is basically equivalent to running this:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ ssh git.example.com "git-upload-pack '/project.git'"</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For a server to support Git pushing and pulling for a given user over SSH, that user needs to be able to execute one or both of those commands via the SSH shell that they are provided on login. On some systems, that shell access is limited to only being able to run those two commands, or even just one of them.</p>   <p>In an ssh:// format URI, it’s absolute in the URI, so the <code>/</code> after the host name (or port number) is sent as an argument, which is then read by the remote git-upload-pack exactly as is, so it’s effectively an absolute path in the remote filesystem.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>   git clone ssh://user@example.com/project.git
  |
  v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack '/project.git'"</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In a "user@host:path" format URI, its relative to the user’s home directory, because the Git client will run:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>   git clone user@example.com:project.git
    |
    v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack 'project.git'"</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The exception is if a <code>~</code> is used, in which case we execute it without the leading <code>/</code>.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>   ssh://user@example.com/~alice/project.git,
    |
    v
ssh user@example.com "git-upload-pack '~alice/project.git'"</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Depending on the value of the <code>protocol.version</code> configuration variable, Git may attempt to send Extra Parameters as a colon-separated string in the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable. This is done only if the <code>ssh.variant</code> configuration variable indicates that the ssh command supports passing environment variables as an argument.</p>   <p>A few things to remember here:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The "command name" is spelled with dash (e.g. git-upload-pack), but this can be overridden by the client;</p> </li> <li> <p>The repository path is always quoted with single quotes.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_fetching_data_from_a_server">Fetching data from a server</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>When one Git repository wants to get data that a second repository has, the first can <code>fetch</code> from the second. This operation determines what data the server has that the client does not then streams that data down to the client in packfile format.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_reference_discovery">Reference discovery</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>When the client initially connects the server will immediately respond with a version number (if "version=1" is sent as an Extra Parameter), and a listing of each reference it has (all branches and tags) along with the object name that each reference currently points to.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre> $ echo -e -n "0045git-upload-pack /schacon/gitbook.git\0host=example.com\0\0version=1\0" |

This can happen with the ls-remote command, and also can happen when the client already is up to date.</p>   <p>Otherwise, it enters the negotiation phase, where the client and server determine what the minimal packfile necessary for transport is, by telling the server what objects it wants, its shallow objects (if any), and the maximum commit depth it wants (if any). The client will also send a list of the capabilities it wants to be in effect, out of what the server said it could do with the first <code>want</code> line.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>  upload-request    =  want-list

Clients MUST send at least one <code>want</code> command in the request body. Clients MUST NOT mention an obj-id in a <code>want</code> command which did not appear in the response obtained through ref discovery.</p>   <p>The client MUST write all obj-ids which it only has shallow copies of (meaning that it does not have the parents of a commit) as <code>shallow</code> lines so that the server is aware of the limitations of the client’s history.</p>   <p>The client now sends the maximum commit history depth it wants for this transaction, which is the number of commits it wants from the tip of the history, if any, as a <code>deepen</code> line. A depth of 0 is the same as not making a depth request. The client does not want to receive any commits beyond this depth, nor does it want objects needed only to complete those commits. Commits whose parents are not received as a result are defined as shallow and marked as such in the server. This information is sent back to the client in the next step.</p>   <p>The client can optionally request that pack-objects omit various objects from the packfile using one of several filtering techniques. These are intended for use with partial clone and partial fetch operations. An object that does not meet a filter-spec value is omitted unless explicitly requested in a <code>want</code> line. See <code>rev-list</code> for possible filter-spec values.</p>   <p>Once all the <code>want’s and 'shallow’s (and optional 'deepen</code>) are transferred, clients MUST send a flush-pkt, to tell the server side that it is done sending the list.</p>   <p>Otherwise, if the client sent a positive depth request, the server will determine which commits will and will not be shallow and send this information to the client.

The server writes an <code>unshallow</code> line for each commit which the client has indicated is shallow, but is no longer shallow at the currently requested depth (that is, its parents will now be sent). The server MUST NOT mark as unshallow anything which the client has not indicated was shallow.</p>   <p>Now the client will send a list of the obj-ids it has using <code>have</code> lines, so the server can make a packfile that only contains the objects that the client needs. In multi_ack mode, the canonical implementation will send up to 32 of these at a time, then will send a flush-pkt. The canonical implementation will skip ahead and send the next 32 immediately, so that there is always a block of 32 "in-flight on the wire" at a time.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>  upload-haves      =  have-list

After that it says nothing until the client gives it a "done".</p> </li> <li> <p>upload-pack sends "NAK" on a flush-pkt if no common object has been found yet. If one has been found, and thus an ACK was already sent, it’s silent on the flush-pkt.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>After the client has gotten enough ACK responses that it can determine that the server has enough information to send an efficient packfile (in the canonical implementation, this is determined when it has received enough ACKs that it can color everything left in the --date-order queue as common with the server, or the --date-order queue is empty), or the client determines that it wants to give up (in the canonical implementation, this is determined when the client sends 256 <code>have</code> lines without getting any of them ACKed by the server - meaning there is nothing in common and the server should just send all of its objects), then the client will send a <code>done</code> command. The <code>done</code> command signals to the server that the client is ready to receive its packfile data.</p>   <p>However, the 256 limit <strong>only</strong> turns on in the canonical client implementation if we have received at least one "ACK %s continue" during a prior round. This helps to ensure that at least one common ancestor is found before we give up entirely.</p>   <p>Once the <code>done</code> line is read from the client, the server will either send a final <code>ACK obj-id</code> or it will send a <code>NAK</code>. <code>obj-id</code> is the object name of the last commit determined to be common. The server only sends ACK after <code>done</code> if there is at least one common base and multi_ack or multi_ack_detailed is enabled. The server always sends NAK after <code>done</code> if there is no common base found.</p>   <p>Instead of <code>ACK</code> or <code>NAK</code>, the server may send an error message (for example, if it does not recognize an object in a <code>want</code> line received from the client).</p>   <p>Then the server will start sending its packfile data.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>  server-response = *ack_multi ack / nak

In <code>side-band-64k</code> mode it will send up to 65519 data bytes plus 1 control code, for a total of up to 65520 bytes in a pkt-line.</p>   <p>The sideband byte will be a <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> or a <code>3</code>. Sideband <code>1</code> will contain packfile data, sideband <code>2</code> will be used for progress information that the client will generally print to stderr and sideband <code>3</code> is used for error information.</p>   <p>If no <code>side-band</code> capability was specified, the server will stream the entire packfile without multiplexing.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_pushing_data_to_a_server">Pushing data to a server</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Pushing data to a server will invoke the <code>receive-pack</code> process on the server, which will allow the client to tell it which references it should update and then send all the data the server will need for those new references to be complete.

In this case the client MUST send an empty packfile. The only time this is likely to happen is if the client is creating a new branch or a tag that points to an existing obj-id.</p>   <p>The server will receive the packfile, unpack it, then validate each reference that is being updated that it hasn’t changed while the request was being processed (the obj-id is still the same as the old-id), and it will run any update hooks to make sure that the update is acceptable. If all of that is fine, the server will then update the references.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_push_certificate">Push certificate</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>A push certificate begins with a set of header lines.
