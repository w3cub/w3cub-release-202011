Leading and trailing whitespaces are ignored. Lines that begin with <code>#</code> are ignored. Patterns that begin with a double quote are quoted in C style. When the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path.</p>   <p>Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path:</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Set"> Set </dt> <dd> <p>The path has the attribute with special value "true"; this is specified by listing only the name of the attribute in the attribute list.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Unset"> Unset </dt> <dd> <p>The path has the attribute with special value "false"; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with a dash <code>-</code> in the attribute list.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Settoavalue"> Set to a value </dt> <dd> <p>The path has the attribute with specified string value; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute followed by an equal sign <code>=</code> and its value in the attribute list.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Unspecified"> Unspecified </dt> <dd> <p>No pattern matches the path, and nothing says if the path has or does not have the attribute, the attribute for the path is said to be Unspecified.</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <p>When more than one pattern matches the path, a later line overrides an earlier line. This overriding is done per attribute.</p>   <p>The rules by which the pattern matches paths are the same as in <code>.gitignore</code> files (see <a href="gitignore">gitignore[5]</a>), with a few exceptions:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>negative patterns are forbidden</p> </li> <li> <p>patterns that match a directory do not recursively match paths inside that directory (so using the trailing-slash <code>path/</code> syntax is pointless in an attributes file; use <code>path/**</code> instead)</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>When deciding what attributes are assigned to a path, Git consults <code>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</code> file (which has the highest precedence), <code>.gitattributes</code> file in the same directory as the path in question, and its parent directories up to the toplevel of the work tree (the further the directory that contains <code>.gitattributes</code> is from the path in question, the lower its precedence). Finally global and system-wide files are considered (they have the lowest precedence).</p>   <p>When the <code>.gitattributes</code> file is missing from the work tree, the path in the index is used as a fall-back. During checkout process, <code>.gitattributes</code> in the index is used and then the file in the working tree is used as a fall-back.</p>   <p>If you wish to affect only a single repository (i.e., to assign attributes to files that are particular to one user’s workflow for that repository), then attributes should be placed in the <code>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</code> file. Attributes which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories (i.e., attributes of interest to all users) should go into <code>.gitattributes</code> files. Attributes that should affect all repositories for a single user should be placed in a file specified by the <code>core.attributesFile</code> configuration option (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>). Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/attributes is used instead. Attributes for all users on a system should be placed in the <code>$(prefix)/etc/gitattributes</code> file.</p>   <p>Sometimes you would need to override a setting of an attribute for a path to <code>Unspecified</code> state. This can be done by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with an exclamation point <code>!</code>.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_effects">Effects</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Certain operations by Git can be influenced by assigning particular attributes to a path. Currently, the following operations are attributes-aware.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_checking_out_and_checking_in">
Checking-out and checking-in</h3>  <p>These attributes affect how the contents stored in the repository are copied to the working tree files when commands such as <code>git switch</code>, <code>git checkout</code> and <code>git merge</code> run. They also affect how Git stores the contents you prepare in the working tree in the repository upon <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_text">
<code>text</code>
</h4>  <p>This attribute marks the path as a text file, which enables end-of-line conversion: When a matching file is added to the index, the file’s line endings are normalized to LF in the index. Conversely, when the file is copied from the index to the working directory, its line endings may be converted from LF to CRLF depending on the <code>eol</code> attribute, the Git config, and the platform (see explanation of <code>eol</code> below).</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Set-1"> Set </dt> <dd> <p>Setting the <code>text</code> attribute on a path enables end-of-line conversion on checkin and checkout as described above.

<code>eol</code>
</h4>  <p>This attribute marks a path to use a specific line-ending style in the working tree when it is checked out. It has effect only if <code>text</code> or <code>text=auto</code> is set (see above), but specifying <code>eol</code> automatically sets <code>text</code> if <code>text</code> was left unspecified.</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Settostringvaluecrlf"> Set to string value "crlf" </dt> <dd> <p>This setting converts the file’s line endings in the working directory to CRLF when the file is checked out.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Settostringvaluelf"> Set to string value "lf" </dt> <dd> <p>This setting uses the same line endings in the working directory as in the index when the file is checked out.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Unspecified-1-1"> Unspecified </dt> <dd> <p>If the <code>eol</code> attribute is unspecified for a file, its line endings in the working directory are determined by the <code>core.autocrlf</code> or <code>core.eol</code> configuration variable (see the definitions of those options in <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>). If <code>text</code> is set but neither of those variables is, the default is <code>eol=crlf</code> on Windows and <code>eol=lf</code> on all other platforms.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_backwards_compatibility_with_crlf_attribute">
Backwards compatibility with <code>crlf</code> attribute</h4>  <p>For backwards compatibility, the <code>crlf</code> attribute is interpreted as follows:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>crlf                text
-crlf                -text

End-of-line conversion</h4>  <p>While Git normally leaves file contents alone, it can be configured to normalize line endings to LF in the repository and, optionally, to convert them to CRLF when files are checked out.</p>   <p>If you simply want to have CRLF line endings in your working directory regardless of the repository you are working with, you can set the config variable "core.autocrlf" without using any attributes.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[core]
        autocrlf = true</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This does not force normalization of text files, but does ensure that text files that you introduce to the repository have their line endings normalized to LF when they are added, and that files that are already normalized in the repository stay normalized.</p>   <p>If you want to ensure that text files that any contributor introduces to the repository have their line endings normalized, you can set the <code>text</code> attribute to "auto" for <code>all</code> files.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*        text=auto</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The attributes allow a fine-grained control, how the line endings are converted. Here is an example that will make Git normalize .txt, .vcproj and .sh files, ensure that .vcproj files have CRLF and .sh files have LF in the working directory, and prevent .jpg files from being normalized regardless of their content.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*               text=auto

<code>working-tree-encoding</code>
</h4>  <p>Git recognizes files encoded in ASCII or one of its supersets (e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, …​) as text files. Files encoded in certain other encodings (e.g. UTF-16) are interpreted as binary and consequently built-in Git text processing tools (e.g. <code>git diff</code>) as well as most Git web front ends do not visualize the contents of these files by default.</p>   <p>In these cases you can tell Git the encoding of a file in the working directory with the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute. If a file with this attribute is added to Git, then Git re-encodes the content from the specified encoding to UTF-8. Finally, Git stores the UTF-8 encoded content in its internal data structure (called "the index"). On checkout the content is re-encoded back to the specified encoding.</p>   <p>Please note that using the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute may have a number of pitfalls:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Alternative Git implementations (e.g. JGit or libgit2) and older Git versions (as of March 2018) do not support the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute. If you decide to use the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute in your repository, then it is strongly recommended to ensure that all clients working with the repository support it.</p>  <p>For example, Microsoft Visual Studio resources files (<code>*.rc</code>) or PowerShell script files (<code>*.ps1</code>) are sometimes encoded in UTF-16. If you declare <code>*.ps1</code> as files as UTF-16 and you add <code>foo.ps1</code> with a <code>working-tree-encoding</code> enabled Git client, then <code>foo.ps1</code> will be stored as UTF-8 internally. A client without <code>working-tree-encoding</code> support will checkout <code>foo.ps1</code> as UTF-8 encoded file. This will typically cause trouble for the users of this file.</p>   <p>If a Git client that does not support the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute adds a new file <code>bar.ps1</code>, then <code>bar.ps1</code> will be stored "as-is" internally (in this example probably as UTF-16). A client with <code>working-tree-encoding</code> support will interpret the internal contents as UTF-8 and try to convert it to UTF-16 on checkout. That operation will fail and cause an error.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Reencoding content to non-UTF encodings can cause errors as the conversion might not be UTF-8 round trip safe. If you suspect your encoding to not be round trip safe, then add it to <code>core.checkRoundtripEncoding</code> to make Git check the round trip encoding (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>). SHIFT-JIS (Japanese character set) is known to have round trip issues with UTF-8 and is checked by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reencoding content requires resources that might slow down certain Git operations (e.g <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git add</code>).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Use the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute only if you cannot store a file in UTF-8 encoding and if you want Git to be able to process the content as text.</p>   <p>As an example, use the following attributes if your <code>*.ps1</code> files are UTF-16 encoded with byte order mark (BOM) and you want Git to perform automatic line ending conversion based on your platform.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps1                text working-tree-encoding=UTF-16</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Use the following attributes if your <code>*.ps1</code> files are UTF-16 little endian encoded without BOM and you want Git to use Windows line endings in the working directory (use <code>UTF-16LE-BOM</code> instead of <code>UTF-16LE</code> if you want UTF-16 little endian with BOM). Please note, it is highly recommended to explicitly define the line endings with <code>eol</code> if the <code>working-tree-encoding</code> attribute is used to avoid ambiguity.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps1                text working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE eol=CRLF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can get a list of all available encodings on your platform with the following command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>iconv --list</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you do not know the encoding of a file, then you can use the <code>file</code> command to guess the encoding:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>file foo.ps1</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_ident">
<code>ident</code>
</h4>  <p>When the attribute <code>ident</code> is set for a path, Git replaces <code>$Id$</code> in the blob object with <code>$Id:</code>, followed by the 40-character hexadecimal blob object name, followed by a dollar sign <code>$</code> upon checkout. Any byte sequence that begins with <code>$Id:</code> and ends with <code>$</code> in the worktree file is replaced with <code>$Id$</code> upon check-in.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_filter">
<code>filter</code>
</h4>  <p>A <code>filter</code> attribute can be set to a string value that names a filter driver specified in the configuration.</p>   <p>A filter driver consists of a <code>clean</code> command and a <code>smudge</code> command, either of which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the <code>smudge</code> command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the <code>clean</code> command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin. By default these commands process only a single blob and terminate. If a long running <code>process</code> filter is used in place of <code>clean</code> and/or <code>smudge</code> filters, then Git can process all blobs with a single filter command invocation for the entire life of a single Git command, for example <code>git add --all</code>. If a long running <code>process</code> filter is configured then it always takes precedence over a configured single blob filter. See section below for the description of the protocol used to communicate with a <code>process</code> filter.</p>   <p>One use of the content filtering is to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use. For this mode of operation, the key phrase here is "more convenient" and not "turning something unusable into usable". In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.</p>   <p>Another use of the content filtering is to store the content that cannot be directly used in the repository (e.g. a UUID that refers to the true content stored outside Git, or an encrypted content) and turn it into a usable form upon checkout (e.g. download the external content, or decrypt the encrypted content).</p>   <p>These two filters behave differently, and by default, a filter is taken as the former, massaging the contents into more convenient shape. A missing filter driver definition in the config, or a filter driver that exits with a non-zero status, is not an error but makes the filter a no-op passthru.</p>   <p>You can declare that a filter turns a content that by itself is unusable into a usable content by setting the filter.&lt;driver&gt;.required configuration variable to <code>true</code>.</p>   <p>Note: Whenever the clean filter is changed, the repo should be renormalized: $ git add --renormalize .</p>   <p>For example, in .gitattributes, you would assign the <code>filter</code> attribute for paths.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.c        filter=indent</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then you would define a "filter.indent.clean" and "filter.indent.smudge" configuration in your .git/config to specify a pair of commands to modify the contents of C programs when the source files are checked in ("clean" is run) and checked out (no change is made because the command is "cat").</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "indent"]
        clean = indent
        smudge = cat</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For best results, <code>clean</code> should not alter its output further if it is run twice ("clean→clean" should be equivalent to "clean"), and multiple <code>smudge</code> commands should not alter <code>clean</code>'s output ("smudge→smudge→clean" should be equivalent to "clean"). See the section on merging below.</p>   <p>The "indent" filter is well-behaved in this regard: it will not modify input that is already correctly indented. In this case, the lack of a smudge filter means that the clean filter <code>must</code> accept its own output without modifying it.</p>   <p>If a filter <code>must</code> succeed in order to make the stored contents usable, you can declare that the filter is <code>required</code>, in the configuration:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "crypt"]
        clean = openssl enc ...
        smudge = openssl enc -d ...
        required</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Sequence "%f" on the filter command line is replaced with the name of the file the filter is working on. A filter might use this in keyword substitution. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "p4"]
        clean = git-p4-filter --clean %f
        smudge = git-p4-filter --smudge %f</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note that "%f" is the name of the path that is being worked on. Depending on the version that is being filtered, the corresponding file on disk may not exist, or may have different contents. So, smudge and clean commands should not try to access the file on disk, but only act as filters on the content provided to them on standard input.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_long_running_filter_process">
Long Running Filter Process</h4>  <p>If the filter command (a string value) is defined via <code>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.process</code> then Git can process all blobs with a single filter invocation for the entire life of a single Git command. This is achieved by using the long-running process protocol (described in technical/long-running-process-protocol.txt).</p>   <p>When Git encounters the first file that needs to be cleaned or smudged, it starts the filter and performs the handshake. In the handshake, the welcome message sent by Git is "git-filter-client", only version 2 is supported, and the supported capabilities are "clean", "smudge", and "delay".</p>   <p>Afterwards Git sends a list of "key=value" pairs terminated with a flush packet. The list will contain at least the filter command (based on the supported capabilities) and the pathname of the file to filter relative to the repository root. Right after the flush packet Git sends the content split in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet to terminate content. Please note, that the filter must not send any response before it received the content and the final flush packet. Also note that the "value" of a "key=value" pair can contain the "=" character whereas the key would never contain that character.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>packet:          git&gt; command=smudge

packet:          git&gt; CONTENT
packet:          git&gt; 0000</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The filter is expected to respond with a list of "key=value" pairs terminated with a flush packet. If the filter does not experience problems then the list must contain a "success" status. Right after these packets the filter is expected to send the content in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet at the end. Finally, a second list of "key=value" pairs terminated with a flush packet is expected. The filter can change the status in the second list or keep the status as is with an empty list. Please note that the empty list must be terminated with a flush packet regardless.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>packet:          git&lt; status=success

Customizing word diff</h4>  <p>You can customize the rules that <code>git diff --word-diff</code> uses to split words in a line, by specifying an appropriate regular expression in the "diff.*.wordRegex" configuration variable.

Performing text diffs of binary files</h4>  <p>Sometimes it is desirable to see the diff of a text-converted version of some binary files. For example, a word processor document can be converted to an ASCII text representation, and the diff of the text shown. Even though this conversion loses some information, the resulting diff is useful for human viewing (but cannot be applied directly).</p>   <p>The <code>textconv</code> config option is used to define a program for performing such a conversion. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout.</p>   <p>For example, to show the diff of the exif information of a file instead of the binary information (assuming you have the exif tool installed), add the following section to your <code>$GIT_DIR/config</code> file (or <code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code> file):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "jpg"]
        textconv = exif</pre> </div> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> The text conversion is generally a one-way conversion; in this example, we lose the actual image contents and focus just on the text data. This means that diffs generated by textconv are <em>not</em> suitable for applying. For this reason, only <code>git diff</code> and the <code>git log</code> family of commands (i.e., log, whatchanged, show) will perform text conversion. <code>git
format-patch</code> will never generate this output. If you want to send somebody a text-converted diff of a binary file (e.g., because it quickly conveys the changes you have made), you should generate it separately and send it as a comment <em>in addition to</em> the usual binary diff that you might send. </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>Because text conversion can be slow, especially when doing a large number of them with <code>git log -p</code>, Git provides a mechanism to cache the output and use it in future diffs. To enable caching, set the "cachetextconv" variable in your diff driver’s config. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "jpg"]
        textconv = exif
        cachetextconv = true</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will cache the result of running "exif" on each blob indefinitely. If you change the textconv config variable for a diff driver, Git will automatically invalidate the cache entries and re-run the textconv filter. If you want to invalidate the cache manually (e.g., because your version of "exif" was updated and now produces better output), you can remove the cache manually with <code>git update-ref -d refs/notes/textconv/jpg</code> (where "jpg" is the name of the diff driver, as in the example above).</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_choosing_textconv_versus_external_diff">
Choosing textconv versus external diff</h4>  <p>If you want to show differences between binary or specially-formatted blobs in your repository, you can choose to use either an external diff command, or to use textconv to convert them to a diff-able text format. Which method you choose depends on your exact situation.</p>   <p>The advantage of using an external diff command is flexibility. You are not bound to find line-oriented changes, nor is it necessary for the output to resemble unified diff. You are free to locate and report changes in the most appropriate way for your data format.</p>   <p>A textconv, by comparison, is much more limiting. You provide a transformation of the data into a line-oriented text format, and Git uses its regular diff tools to generate the output. There are several advantages to choosing this method:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Ease of use. It is often much simpler to write a binary to text transformation than it is to perform your own diff. In many cases, existing programs can be used as textconv filters (e.g., exif, odt2txt).</p> </li> <li> <p>Git diff features. By performing only the transformation step yourself, you can still utilize many of Git’s diff features, including colorization, word-diff, and combined diffs for merges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caching. Textconv caching can speed up repeated diffs, such as those you might trigger by running <code>git log -p</code>.</p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_marking_files_as_binary">
Marking files as binary</h4>  <p>Git usually guesses correctly whether a blob contains text or binary data by examining the beginning of the contents. However, sometimes you may want to override its decision, either because a blob contains binary data later in the file, or because the content, while technically composed of text characters, is opaque to a human reader. For example, many postscript files contain only ASCII characters, but produce noisy and meaningless diffs.</p>   <p>The simplest way to mark a file as binary is to unset the diff attribute in the <code>.gitattributes</code> file:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps -diff</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will cause Git to generate <code>Binary files differ</code> (or a binary patch, if binary patches are enabled) instead of a regular diff.</p>   <p>However, one may also want to specify other diff driver attributes. For example, you might want to use <code>textconv</code> to convert postscript files to an ASCII representation for human viewing, but otherwise treat them as binary files. You cannot specify both <code>-diff</code> and <code>diff=ps</code> attributes. The solution is to use the <code>diff.*.binary</code> config option:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "ps"]

This attribute gives you finer control per path.</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Set-1-1-1-1"> Set </dt> <dd> <p>Notice all types of potential whitespace errors known to Git. The tab width is taken from the value of the <code>core.whitespace</code> configuration variable.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Unset-1-1-1-1"> Unset </dt> <dd> <p>Do not notice anything as error.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-Unspecified-1-1-1-1-1"> Unspecified </dt> <dd> <p>Use the value of the <code>core.whitespace</code> configuration variable to decide what to notice as error.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/gitattributes.txt-String-1-1"> String </dt> <dd> <p>Specify a comma separated list of common whitespace problems to notice in the same format as the <code>core.whitespace</code> configuration variable.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_creating_an_archive">

<code>export-ignore</code>
</h4>  <p>Files and directories with the attribute <code>export-ignore</code> won’t be added to archive files.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_export_subst">
<code>export-subst</code>
</h4>  <p>If the attribute <code>export-subst</code> is set for a file then Git will expand several placeholders when adding this file to an archive. The expansion depends on the availability of a commit ID, i.e., if <a href="git-archive">git-archive[1]</a> has been given a tree instead of a commit or a tag then no replacement will be done. The placeholders are the same as those for the option <code>--pretty=format:</code> of <a href="git-log">git-log[1]</a>, except that they need to be wrapped like this: <code>$Format:PLACEHOLDERS$</code> in the file. E.g. the string <code>$Format:%H$</code> will be replaced by the commit hash. However, only one <code>%(describe)</code> placeholder is expanded per archive to avoid denial-of-service attacks.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_packing_objects">

<code>encoding</code>
</h4>  <p>The value of this attribute specifies the character encoding that should be used by GUI tools (e.g. <a href="gitk">gitk[1]</a> and <a href="git-gui">git-gui[1]</a>) to display the contents of the relevant file. Note that due to performance considerations <a href="gitk">gitk[1]</a> does not use this attribute unless you manually enable per-file encodings in its options.</p>   <p>If this attribute is not set or has an invalid value, the value of the <code>gui.encoding</code> configuration variable is used instead (See <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>).</p>  </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_using_macro_attributes">Using macro attributes</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>You do not want any end-of-line conversions applied to, nor textual diffs produced for, any binary file you track. You would need to specify e.g.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.jpg -text -diff</pre> </div> </div>  <p>but that may become cumbersome, when you have many attributes. Using macro attributes, you can define an attribute that, when set, also sets or unsets a number of other attributes at the same time. The system knows a built-in macro attribute, <code>binary</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.jpg binary</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Setting the "binary" attribute also unsets the "text" and "diff" attributes as above. Note that macro attributes can only be "Set", though setting one might have the effect of setting or unsetting other attributes or even returning other attributes to the "Unspecified" state.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_defining_macro_attributes">Defining macro attributes</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Custom macro attributes can be defined only in top-level gitattributes files (<code>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</code>, the <code>.gitattributes</code> file at the top level of the working tree, or the global or system-wide gitattributes files), not in <code>.gitattributes</code> files in working tree subdirectories. The built-in macro attribute "binary" is equivalent to:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[attr]binary -diff -merge -text</pre> </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_notes">Notes</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Git does not follow symbolic links when accessing a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in the working tree. This keeps behavior consistent when the file is accessed from the index or a tree versus from the filesystem.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_examples">Examples</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>If you have these three <code>gitattributes</code> file:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>(in $GIT_DIR/info/attributes)

a*        foo !bar -baz

(in .gitattributes)
abc        foo bar baz

(in t/.gitattributes)
ab*        merge=filfre
abc        -foo -bar
*.c        frotz</pre> </div> </div>  <p>the attributes given to path <code>t/abc</code> are computed as follows:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>By examining <code>t/.gitattributes</code> (which is in the same directory as the path in question), Git finds that the first line matches. <code>merge</code> attribute is set. It also finds that the second line matches, and attributes <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are unset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then it examines <code>.gitattributes</code> (which is in the parent directory), and finds that the first line matches, but <code>t/.gitattributes</code> file already decided how <code>merge</code>, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> attributes should be given to this path, so it leaves <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> unset. Attribute <code>baz</code> is set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally it examines <code>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</code>. This file is used to override the in-tree settings. The first line is a match, and <code>foo</code> is set, <code>bar</code> is reverted to unspecified state, and <code>baz</code> is unset.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>As the result, the attributes assignment to <code>t/abc</code> becomes:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>foo        set to true
bar        unspecified
baz        set to false
merge        set to string value "filfre"
