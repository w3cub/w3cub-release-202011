You can also use most of the GNU compiler options regardless of what language your program is in. For example, you might compile a file <samp>firstClass.C</samp> like this: </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C</pre>
</div> <p>In this example, only <samp>-fstrict-enums</samp> is an option meant only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any language supported by GCC. </p> <p>Some options for compiling C programs, such as <samp>-std</samp>, are also relevant for C++ programs. See <a href="c-dialect-options#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>. </p> <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs: </p> <dl compact> <dt><code>-fabi-version=<var>n</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fabi-version">Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI. The default is version 0. </p> <p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to the C++ ABI specification. Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed. </p> <p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2. </p> <p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9. </p> <p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a template argument. </p> <p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for vector types. </p> <p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of another parameter. </p> <p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and –, and a class scope function used as a template argument. </p> <p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument scope. </p> <p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers. </p> <p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of <code>nullptr_t</code>. </p> <p>Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention attributes (e.g. ‘<samp>stdcall</samp>’). </p> <p>Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of sizeof... expressions and operator names. For multiple entities with the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes, the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence. It also implies <samp>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</samp>. </p> <p>Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes with only deleted copy/move constructors. It accidentally changes the calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a trivial move constructor. </p> <p>Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental change in version 12. </p> <p>Version 14, which first appeared in G++ 10, corrects the mangling of the nullptr expression. </p> <p>Version 15, which first appeared in G++ 11, changes the mangling of <code>__alignof__</code> to be distinct from that of <code>alignof</code>, and dependent operator names. </p> <p>See also <samp>-Wabi</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=<var>n</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fabi-compat-version">On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name. This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias. </p> <p>With <samp>-fabi-version=0</samp> (the default), this defaults to 11 (GCC 7 compatibility). If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this defaults to 0. For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9, use <samp>-fabi-compat-version=2</samp>. </p> <p>If this option is not provided but <samp>-Wabi=<var>n</var></samp> is, that version is used for compatibility aliases. If this option is provided along with <samp>-Wabi</samp> (without the version), the version from this option is used for the warning. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-access-control</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-faccess-control">Turn off all access checking. This switch is mainly useful for working around bugs in the access control code. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-faligned-new</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-faligned-new">Enable support for C++17 <code>new</code> of types that require more alignment than <code>void* ::operator new(std::size_t)</code> provides. A numeric argument such as <code>-faligned-new=32</code> can be used to specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function, but few users will need to override the default of <code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code>. </p> <p>This flag is enabled by default for <samp>-std=c++17</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fchar8_t</code></dt> <dt><code>-fno-char8_t</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fno-char8_005ft">Enable support for <code>char8_t</code> as adopted for C++20. This includes the addition of a new <code>char8_t</code> fundamental type, changes to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals, new signatures for user-defined literals, associated standard library updates, and new <code>__cpp_char8_t</code> and <code>__cpp_lib_char8_t</code> feature test macros. </p> <p>This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary and UTF-8 strings: </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">int f(const char *);    // #1
int f(const char8_t *); // #2
int v1 = f("text");     // Calls #1
int v2 = f(u8"text");   // Calls #2</pre>

int v4 = u8"text"_udl2;
template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator""_udl3();
int v5 = u8"text"_udl3;</pre>
</div> <p>The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals introduces incompatibilities with ISO C++11 and later standards.

</div> </dd> <dt><code>-fcheck-new</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fcheck-new">Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null before attempting to modify the storage allocated. This check is normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that <code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared <code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the return value even without this option. In all other cases, when <code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>. See also ‘<samp>new (nothrow)</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fconcepts</code></dt> <dt><code>-fconcepts-ts</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fconcepts-ts">Below <samp>-std=c++20</samp>, <samp>-fconcepts</samp> enables support for the C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical Specification, ISO 19217 (2015). </p> <p>With <samp>-std=c++20</samp> and above, Concepts are part of the language standard, so <samp>-fconcepts</samp> defaults to on. But the standard specification of Concepts differs significantly from the TS, so some constructs that were allowed in the TS but didn’t make it into the standard can still be enabled by <samp>-fconcepts-ts</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fconstexpr-depth">Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions to <var>n</var>. A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during constant expression evaluation. The minimum specified by the standard is 512. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fconstexpr-cache-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fconstexpr-cache-depth">Set the maximum level of nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions that will be cached to <var>n</var>. This is a heuristic that trades off compilation speed (when the cache avoids repeated calculations) against memory consumption (when the cache grows very large from highly recursive evaluations). The default is 8. Very few users are likely to want to adjust it, but if your code does heavy constexpr calculations you might want to experiment to find which value works best for you. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fconstexpr-fp-except</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fconstexpr-fp-except">Annex F of the C standard specifies that IEC559 floating point exceptions encountered at compile time should not stop compilation. C++ compilers have historically not followed this guidance, instead treating floating point division by zero as non-constant even though it has a well defined value. This flag tells the compiler to give Annex F priority over other rules saying that a particular operation is undefined. </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">constexpr float inf = 1./0.; // OK with -fconstexpr-fp-except</pre>

Even when number of iterations of a single loop is limited with the above limit, if there are several nested loops and each of them has many iterations but still smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some loop or even outside of a loop too many expressions need to be evaluated, the resulting constexpr evaluation might take too long. The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25). </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fcoroutines</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fcoroutines">Enable support for the C++ coroutines extension (experimental). </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-felide-constructors">The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary that is only used to initialize another object of the same type. Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases. This option also causes G++ to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline. </p> <p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this option still affects trivial member functions. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fenforce-eh-specs">Don’t generate code to check for violation of exception specifications at run time. This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining <code>NDEBUG</code>. This does not give user code permission to throw exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code></dt> <dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fno-extern-tls-init">The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and <code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime) initialization. To support this, any use of such a variable goes through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization. When the use and definition of the variable are in the same translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead even if the variable doesn’t actually need dynamic initialization. If the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the <samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp> option. </p> <p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is <samp>-fextern-tls-init</samp>. On targets that do not support symbol aliases, the default is <samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-ffold-simple-inlines</code></dt> <dt><code>-fno-fold-simple-inlines</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fno-fold-simple-inlines">Permit the C++ frontend to fold calls to <code>std::move</code>, <code>std::forward</code>, <code>std::addressof</code> and <code>std::as_const</code>. In contrast to inlining, this means no debug information will be generated for such calls. Since these functions are rarely interesting to debug, this flag is enabled by default unless <samp>-fno-inline</samp> is active. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fgnu-keywords">Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this word as an identifier.

If you use this option, you must take care to structure your code to include all the necessary explicit instantiations to avoid getting undefined symbols at link time. See <a href="template-instantiation#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-fimplicit-inline-templates">Don’t emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.

If the function has local variables of types with non-trivial destructors, the exception specification actually makes the function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be optimized away.

When an error message refers to a specialization of a class template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match the default template arguments for that template. If either of these behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than easier, you can use <samp>-fno-pretty-templates</samp> to disable them. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-rtti</code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-frtti">Disable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features (<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).

The compiler doesn’t give this warning for types defined in the main .C file, as those are unlikely to have multiple definitions. <samp>-Wsubobject-linkage</samp> is enabled by default. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-Weffc++ <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-Wno-effc_002b_002b">Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers’ Effective C++ series of books: </p> <ul> <li> Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with dynamically-allocated memory. </li>
