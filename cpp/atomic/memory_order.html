Absent any constraints on a multi-core system, when multiple threads simultaneously read and write to several variables, one thread can observe the values change in an order different from the order another thread wrote them. Indeed, the apparent order of changes can even differ among multiple reader threads. Some similar effects can occur even on uniprocessor systems due to compiler transformations allowed by the memory model.</p>
<p>The default behavior of all atomic operations in the library provides for <i>sequentially consistent ordering</i> (see discussion below). That default can hurt performance, but the library's atomic operations can be given an additional <code>std::memory_order</code> argument to specify the exact constraints, beyond atomicity, that the compiler and processor must enforce for that operation.</p>

<h3 id="Explanation">Explanation</h3> <h4 id="Relaxed_ordering">Relaxed ordering</h4> <p>Atomic operations tagged <code>memory_order_relaxed</code> are not synchronization operations; they do not impose an order among concurrent memory accesses. They only guarantee atomicity and modification order consistency.</p>
<p>For example, with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> initially zero,</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">// Thread 1:
r1 = y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); // A
x.store(r1, std::memory_order_relaxed); // B
// Thread 2:
r2 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); // C 
y.store(42, std::memory_order_relaxed); // D</pre></div> <p>is allowed to produce <code>r1 == r2 == 42</code> because, although A is <i>sequenced-before</i> B within thread 1 and C is <i>sequenced before</i> D within thread 2, nothing prevents D from appearing before A in the modification order of y, and B from appearing before C in the modification order of x. The side-effect of D on y could be visible to the load A in thread 1 while the side effect of B on x could be visible to the load C in thread 2. In particular, this may occur if D is completed before C in thread 2, either due to compiler reordering or at runtime.</p>
<table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-cxx14">
<td> <p>Even with relaxed memory model, out-of-thin-air values are not allowed to circularly depend on their own computations, for example, with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> initially zero,</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">// Thread 1:
r1 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
if (r1 == 42) y.store(r1, std::memory_order_relaxed);

</tr> </table> <p>Typical use for relaxed memory ordering is incrementing counters, such as the reference counters of <code><a href="../memory/shared_ptr" title="cpp/memory/shared ptr">std::shared_ptr</a></code>, since this only requires atomicity, but not ordering or synchronization (note that decrementing the shared_ptr counters requires acquire-release synchronization with the destructor).</p>

That is, once the atomic load is completed, thread B is guaranteed to see everything thread A wrote to memory.</p>
<p>The synchronization is established only between the threads <i>releasing</i> and <i>acquiring</i> the same atomic variable. Other threads can see different order of memory accesses than either or both of the synchronized threads.</p>
<p>On strongly-ordered systems — x86, SPARC TSO, IBM mainframe, etc. — release-acquire ordering is automatic for the majority of operations. No additional CPU instructions are issued for this synchronization mode; only certain compiler optimizations are affected (e.g., the compiler is prohibited from moving non-atomic stores past the atomic store-release or performing non-atomic loads earlier than the atomic load-acquire). On weakly-ordered systems (ARM, Itanium, PowerPC), special CPU load or memory fence instructions are used.</p>
<p>Mutual exclusion locks, such as <code><a href="../thread/mutex" title="cpp/thread/mutex">std::mutex</a></code> or <a href="atomic_flag" title="cpp/atomic/atomic flag">atomic spinlock</a>, are an example of release-acquire synchronization: when the lock is released by thread A and acquired by thread B, everything that took place in the critical section (before the release) in the context of thread A has to be visible to thread B (after the acquire) which is executing the same critical section.</p>

<p>The synchronization is established only between the threads <i>releasing</i> and <i>consuming</i> the same atomic variable. Other threads can see different order of memory accesses than either or both of the synchronized threads.</p>
<p>On all mainstream CPUs other than DEC Alpha, dependency ordering is automatic, no additional CPU instructions are issued for this synchronization mode, only certain compiler optimizations are affected (e.g. the compiler is prohibited from performing speculative loads on the objects that are involved in the dependency chain).</p>
<p>Typical use cases for this ordering involve read access to rarely written concurrent data structures (routing tables, configuration, security policies, firewall rules, etc) and publisher-subscriber situations with pointer-mediated publication, that is, when the producer publishes a pointer through which the consumer can access information: there is no need to make everything else the producer wrote to memory visible to the consumer (which may be an expensive operation on weakly-ordered architectures). An example of such scenario is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Read-copy-update">rcu_dereference</a>.</p>

<p>Note that currently (2/2015) no known production compilers track dependency chains: consume operations are lifted to acquire operations.</p>

</h3> <p>Within a thread of execution, accesses (reads and writes) through <a href="../language/cv" title="cpp/language/cv">volatile glvalues</a> cannot be reordered past observable side-effects (including other volatile accesses) that are <i>sequenced-before</i> or <i>sequenced-after</i> within the same thread, but this order is not guaranteed to be observed by another thread, since volatile access does not establish inter-thread synchronization.</p>
<p>In addition, volatile accesses are not atomic (concurrent read and write is a <a href="../language/memory_model" title="cpp/language/memory model">data race</a>) and do not order memory (non-volatile memory accesses may be freely reordered around the volatile access).</p>
<p>One notable exception is Visual Studio, where, with default settings, every volatile write has release semantics and every volatile read has acquire semantics (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/12a04hfd(v=vs.100).aspx">MSDN</a>), and thus volatiles may be used for inter-thread synchronization. Standard <code>volatile</code> semantics are not applicable to multithreaded programming, although they are sufficient for e.g. communication with a <code><a href="../utility/program/signal" title="cpp/utility/program/signal">std::signal</a></code> handler that runs in the same thread when applied to <code>sig_atomic_t</code> variables.</p>
