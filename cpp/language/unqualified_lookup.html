<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Unqualified name lookup</h1>            <p>For an <i>unqualified</i> name, that is a name that does not appear to the right of a scope resolution operator <code>::</code>, name lookup examines the <a href="scope" title="cpp/language/scope">scopes</a> as described below, until it finds at least one declaration of any kind, at which time the lookup stops and no further scopes are examined. (Note: lookup from some contexts skips some declarations, for example, lookup of the name used to the left of <code>::</code> ignores function, variable, and enumerator declarations, lookup of a name used as a base class specifier ignores all non-type declarations).</p>
<p>For the purpose of unqualified name lookup, all declarations from a namespace nominated by a <a href="namespace" title="cpp/language/namespace">using directive</a> appear as if declared in the nearest enclosing namespace which contains, directly or indirectly, both the using-directive and the nominated namespace.</p>
<p>Unqualified name lookup of the name used to the left of the function-call operator (and, equivalently, operator in an expression) is described in <a href="adl" title="cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup</a>.</p>
<h3 id="File_scope">File scope</h3> <p>For a name used in global (top-level namespace) scope, outside of any function, class, or user-declared namespace, the global scope before the use of the name is examined:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">int n = 1;     // declaration of n
int x = n + 1; // OK: lookup finds ::n
 
int z = y - 1; // Error: lookup fails
int y = 2;     // declaration of y</pre></div> <h3 id="Namespace_scope">Namespace scope</h3> <p>For a name used in a user-declared namespace outside of any function or class, this namespace is searched before the use of the name, then the namespace enclosing this namespace before the declaration of this namespace, etc until the global namespace is reached.</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">int n = 1; // declaration
namespace N {
  int m = 2;
  namespace Y {

  }
  int k = 3;
}</pre></div> <h3 id="Definition_outside_of_its_namespace">Definition outside of its namespace</h3> <p>For a name used in the definition of a namespace-member variable outside the namespace, lookup proceeds the same way as for a name used inside the namespace:</p>

Then the namespace in which the function is declared is searched until the definition (not necessarily the declaration) of the function that uses the name, then the enclosing namespaces, etc.</p>

<td>A member name found in a sub-object <code>B</code> hides the same member name in any sub-object <code>A</code> if <code>A</code> is a base class sub-object of <code>B</code>. (Note that this does not hide the name in any additional, non-virtual, copies of <code>A</code> on the inheritance lattice that aren't bases of <code>B</code>: this rule only has an effect on virtual inheritance.) Names introduced by using-declarations are treated as names in the class containing the declaration. After examining each base, the resulting set must either include declarations of a static member from subobjects of the same type, or declarations of non-static members from the same subobject</td> <td><span class="t-mark-rev t-until-cxx11">(until C++11)</span></td>
</tr> <tr class="t-rev t-since-cxx11">
<td>A <i>lookup set</i> is constructed, which consists of the declarations and the subobjects in which these declarations were found. Using-declarations are replaced by the members they represent and type declarations, including injected-class-names are replaced by the types they represent. If <code>C</code> is the class in whose scope the name was used, <code>C</code> is examined first. If the list of declarations in <code>C</code> is empty, lookup set is built for each of its direct bases <code>Bi</code> (recursively applying these rules if <code>Bi</code> has its own bases). Once built, the lookup sets for the direct bases are merged into the lookup set in <code>C</code> as follows <ul>
<li> if the set of declarations in <code>Bi</code> is empty, it is discarded </li>
<li> if the lookup set of <code>C</code> built so far is empty, it is replaced by the lookup set of <code>Bi</code> </li>

<li> if every subobject already added to the lookup set of <code>C</code> is a base of at least one subobject in the lookup set of <code>Bi</code>, then the lookup set of <code>C</code> is discarded and replaced with the lookup set of <code>Bi</code> </li>

}</pre></div> <h3 id="Template_definition">Template definition</h3> <p>For a <a href="dependent_name" title="cpp/language/dependent name">non-dependent name</a> used in a template definition, unqualified name lookup takes place when the template definition is examined. The binding to the declarations made at that point is not affected by declarations visible at the point of instantiation. For a <a href="dependent_name" title="cpp/language/dependent name">dependent name</a> used in a template definition, the lookup is postponed until the template arguments are known, at which time <a href="adl" title="cpp/language/adl">ADL</a> examines function declarations <span class="t-rev-inl t-until-cxx11"><span>with external linkage</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-until-cxx11">(until C++11)</span></span></span> that are visible from the template definition context as well as in the template instantiation context, while non-ADL lookup only examines function declarations <span class="t-rev-inl t-until-cxx11"><span>with external linkage</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-until-cxx11">(until C++11)</span></span></span> that are visible from the template definition context (in other words, adding a new function declaration after template definition does not make it visible except via ADL). The behavior is undefined if there is a better match with external linkage in the namespaces examined by the ADL lookup, declared in some other translation unit, or if the lookup would have been ambiguous if those translation units were examined. In any case, if a base class depends on a template parameter, its scope is not examined by unqualified name lookup (neither at the point of definition nor at the point of instantiation).</p>
