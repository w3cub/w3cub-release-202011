<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Order of evaluation</h1>            <p>Order of evaluation of any part of any expression, including order of evaluation of function arguments is <i>unspecified</i> (with some exceptions listed below). The compiler can evaluate operands and other subexpressions in any order, and may choose another order when the same expression is evaluated again.</p>
<p>There is no concept of left-to-right or right-to-left evaluation in C++. This is not to be confused with left-to-right and right-to-left associativity of operators: the expression <code>a() + b() + c()</code> is parsed as <code>(a() + b()) + c()</code> due to left-to-right associativity of operator+, but <code>c()</code> may be evaluated first, last, or between <code>a()</code> or <code>b()</code> at run time:</p>
<div class="t-example"> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
 
int a() { return std::puts("a"); }
int b() { return std::puts("b"); }
int c() { return std::puts("c"); }
 
void z(int, int, int) {}
 
int main()
{
    z(a(), b(), c());       // all 6 permutations of output are allowed
    return a() + b() + c(); // all 6 permutations of output are allowed
}</pre></div> <p>Possible output:</p>
<div class="text source-text"><pre data-language="c">b
c
a
c

b</pre></div> </div>  <h3 id=".22Sequenced_before.22_rules_.28since_C.2B.2B11.29"> "Sequenced before" rules <span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(since C++11)</span>
</h3> <h4 id="Evaluation_of_Expressions"> Evaluation of Expressions</h4> <p>Evaluation of each expression includes:</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Value computations</i>: calculation of the value that is returned by the expression. This may involve determination of the identity of the object (glvalue evaluation, e.g. if the expression returns a reference to some object) or reading the value previously assigned to an object (prvalue evaluation, e.g. if the expression returns a number, or some other value). </li>
<li> Initiation of <i>side effects</i>: access (read or write) to an object designated by a volatile glvalue, modification (writing) to an object, calling a library I/O function, or calling a function that does any of those operations. </li>
</ul> <h4 id="Ordering"> Ordering</h4> <p><i>Sequenced before</i> is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relationship between evaluations within the same thread.</p>
<ul>
<li> If A is sequenced before B (or, equivalently, B is <i>sequenced after</i> A), then evaluation of A will be complete before evaluation of B begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is sequenced before A, then evaluation of B will be complete before evaluation of A begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced before A, then two possibilities exist: <ul>
<li> Evaluations of A and B are <i>unsequenced</i>: they may be performed in any order and may overlap (within a single thread of execution, the compiler may interleave the CPU instructions that comprise A and B). </li>
<li> Evaluations of A and B are <i>indeterminately sequenced</i>: they may be performed in any order but may not overlap: either A will be complete before B, or B will be complete before A. The order may be the opposite the next time the same expression is evaluated. </li>
