<ol>
<li> Lvalue to rvalue conversion (e.g. function call to a function that takes a value). </li>
<li> Access to a non-static data member or a call to a non-static member function. </li>
<li> Binding a reference to a virtual base class subobject. </li>
<li> <code>dynamic_cast</code> or <code>typeid</code> expressions. </li>
</ol> <p>The above rules apply to pointers as well (binding a reference to virtual base is replaced by implicit conversion to a pointer to virtual base), with two additional rules:</p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="static_cast" title="cpp/language/static cast"><code>static_cast</code></a> of a pointer to storage without an object is only allowed when casting to (possibly cv-qualified) <code>void*</code>. </li>
<li> Pointers to storage without an object that were cast to possibly cv-qualified <code>void*</code> can only be <a href="static_cast" title="cpp/language/static cast"><code>static_cast</code></a> to pointers to possibly cv-qualified <code>char</code>, possibly cv-qualified <code>unsigned char</code>, or possibly cv-qualified <a href="../types/byte" title="cpp/types/byte"><code>std::byte</code></a>. </li>
</ol> <p>During construction and destruction, other restrictions apply, see <a href="virtual#During_construction_and_destruction" title="cpp/language/virtual">virtual function calls during construction and destruction</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3> <p>The difference in the end of lifetime rules between non-class objects (end of storage duration) and class objects (reverse order of construction) matters in the following example:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">struct A {
  int* p;
  ~A() { std::cout &lt;&lt; *p; } // Well-defined and prints 123 because n outlives a

};
void f() {
  A a;
  int n = 123; // if n did not outlive a, this could have been optimized out (dead store)
  a.p = &amp;n;
}</pre></div> <p>At least one major implementation does not implement these rules and instead optimizes out the store to <code>n</code>. The lifetime rules are under reconsideration as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wg21.link/CWG2256">core issue 2256</a>.</p>
