When a name of the member is used anywhere a program, its access is checked, and if it does not satisfy the access rules, the program does not compile:</p>
<div class="t-example"> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
class Example
{
public:             // all declarations after this point are public
    void add(int x) // member "add" has public access
    {
        n += x;     // OK: private Example::n can be accessed from Example::add
    }
private:            // all declarations after this point are private
    int n = 0;      // member "n" has private access
};
 
int main()
{
    Example e;
    e.add(1); // OK: public Example::add can be accessed from main
//  e.n = 7;  // error: private Example::n cannot be accessed from main
}</pre></div> </div> <p>Access specifiers give the author of the class the ability to decide which class members are accessible to the users of the class (that is, the <i>interface</i>) and which members are for internal use of the class (the <i>implementation</i>).</p>
<h3 id="In_detail"> In detail</h3> <p>All members of a class (bodies of <a href="member_functions" title="cpp/language/member functions">member functions</a>, initializers of member objects, and the entire <a href="nested_types" title="cpp/language/nested types">nested class definitions</a>) have access to all names the class can access. A local class within a member function has access to all names the member function can access.</p>
<p>A class defined with the keyword <code>class</code> has private access for its members and its base classes by default. A class defined with the keyword <code>struct</code> has public access for its members and its base classes by default. A <a href="union" title="cpp/language/union">union</a> has public access for its members by default.</p>
<p>To grant access to additional functions or classes to protected or private members, a <a href="friend" title="cpp/language/friend">friendship declaration</a> may be used.</p>
<p>Accessibility applies to all names with no regard to their origin, so a name introduced by a <a href="typedef" title="cpp/language/typedef">typedef</a> or <a href="using_declaration" title="cpp/language/using declaration">using declarations</a> (except inheriting constructors) is checked, not the name it refers to:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class A : X
{
    class B {};   // B is private in A
public:
    typedef B BB; // BB is public
};
 
void f()
{
    A::B y;  // error: A::B is private
    A::BB x; // OK: A::BB is public
}</pre></div> <p>Member access does not affect visibility: names of private and privately-inherited members are visible and considered by overload resolution, implicit conversions to inaccessible base classes are still considered, etc. Member access check is the last step after any given language construct is interpreted. The intent of this rule is that replacing any <code>private</code> with <code>public</code> never alters the behavior of the program.</p>
<p>Access checking for the names used in <a href="default_arguments" title="cpp/language/default arguments">default function arguments</a> as well as in the default <a href="template_parameters#Default_template_arguments" title="cpp/language/template parameters">template parameters</a> is performed at the point of declaration, not at the point of use.</p>
<p>Access rules for the names of <a href="virtual" title="cpp/language/virtual">virtual functions</a> are checked at the call point using the type of the expression used to denote the object for which the member function is called. The access of the final overrider is ignored:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">struct B { virtual int f(); };            // f is public in B
 
class D : public B { private: int f(); }; // f is private in D
 
void f()
{
    D d;
    B&amp; b = d;
 
    b.f(); // OK: B::f is public, D::f is invoked even though it's private
    d.f(); // error: D::f is private
}</pre></div> <p>A name that is private according to unqualified <a href="lookup" title="cpp/language/lookup">name lookup</a>, may be accessible through qualified name lookup:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class A {};
 
class B : private A {};
 
class C : public B
{
    A* p;   // error: unqualified name lookup finds A as the private base of B
    ::A* q; // OK: qualified name lookup finds the namespace-level declaration
};</pre></div> <p>A name that is accessible through multiple paths in the inheritance graph has the access of the path with the most access:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class W { public: void f(); };
 
class A : private virtual W {};
 
class B : public virtual W {};
 
class C : public A, public B
{
    void f() { W::f(); } // OK: W is accessible to C through B
};</pre></div> <p>Any number of access specifiers may appear within a class, in any order. Member access specifiers may affect class layout: the addresses of non-static <a href="data_members#Layout" title="cpp/language/data members">data members</a> are only guaranteed to increase in order of declaration for the members <span class="t-rev-inl t-until-cxx11"><span>not separated by an access specifier</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-until-cxx11">(until C++11)</span></span></span><span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx11"><span>with the same access</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(since C++11)</span></span></span>.</p>
