<h1 class="text-center">Configuration Manual</h1> <div><pre class="text">This document covers the configuration language as implemented in the version
specified above. It does not provide any hints, examples, or advice. For such
documentation, please refer to the Reference Manual or the Architecture Manual.
The summary below is meant to help you find sections by name and navigate
through the document.

Note to documentation contributors :
    This document is formatted with 80 columns per line, with even number of
    spaces for indentation and without tabs. Please follow these rules strictly
    so that it remains easily printable everywhere. If a line needs to be
    printed verbatim and does not fit, please end each line with a backslash
    ('\') and continue on next line, indented by two characters. It is also
    sometimes useful to prefix all output lines (logs, console outputs) with 3
    closing angle brackets ('&gt;&gt;&gt;') in order to emphasize the difference between
    inputs and outputs when they may be ambiguous. If you add sections,
    please update the summary below for easier searching.
</pre></div>     <h2 id="chapter-1">
<small>1.</small> Quick reminder about HTTP</h2> <div><pre class="text">When HAProxy is running in HTTP mode, both the request and the response are
fully analyzed and indexed, thus it becomes possible to build matching criteria
on almost anything found in the contents.

However, it is important to understand how HTTP requests and responses are
formed, and how HAProxy decomposes them. It will then become easier to write
correct rules and to debug existing configurations.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-1.1">
<small>1.1.</small> The HTTP transaction model</h3> <div><pre class="text">The HTTP protocol is transaction-driven. This means that each request will lead
to one and only one response. Traditionally, a TCP connection is established
from the client to the server, a request is sent by the client through the
connection, the server responds, and the connection is closed. A new request
will involve a new connection :

  [CON1] [REQ1] ... [RESP1] [CLO1] [CON2] [REQ2] ... [RESP2] [CLO2] ...

In this mode, called the "HTTP close" mode, there are as many connection
establishments as there are HTTP transactions. Since the connection is closed
by the server after the response, the client does not need to know the content
length.

Due to the transactional nature of the protocol, it was possible to improve it
to avoid closing a connection between two subsequent transactions. In this mode
however, it is mandatory that the server indicates the content length for each
response so that the client does not wait indefinitely. For this, a special
header is used: "Content-length". This mode is called the "keep-alive" mode :

  [CON] [REQ1] ... [RESP1] [REQ2] ... [RESP2] [CLO] ...

Its advantages are a reduced latency between transactions, and less processing
power required on the server side. It is generally better than the close mode,
but not always because the clients often limit their concurrent connections to
a smaller value.

Another improvement in the communications is the pipelining mode. It still uses
keep-alive, but the client does not wait for the first response to send the
second request. This is useful for fetching large number of images composing a
page :

  [CON] [REQ1] [REQ2] ... [RESP1] [RESP2] [CLO] ...

This can obviously have a tremendous benefit on performance because the network
latency is eliminated between subsequent requests. Many HTTP agents do not
correctly support pipelining since there is no way to associate a response with
the corresponding request in HTTP. For this reason, it is mandatory for the
server to reply in the exact same order as the requests were received.

The next improvement is the multiplexed mode, as implemented in HTTP/2. This
time, each transaction is assigned a single stream identifier, and all streams
are multiplexed over an existing connection. Many requests can be sent in
parallel by the client, and responses can arrive in any order since they also
carry the stream identifier.

By default HAProxy operates in keep-alive mode with regards to persistent
connections: for each connection it processes each request and response, and
leaves the connection idle on both sides between the end of a response and the
start of a new request. When it receives HTTP/2 connections from a client, it
processes all the requests in parallel and leaves the connection idling,
waiting for new requests, just as if it was a keep-alive HTTP connection.

HAProxy supports 4 connection modes :
  - keep alive    : all requests and responses are processed (default)
  - tunnel        : only the first request and response are processed,
                    everything else is forwarded with no analysis (deprecated).
  - server close  : the server-facing connection is closed after the response.
  - close         : the connection is actively closed after end of response.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-1.2">
<small>1.2.</small> HTTP request</h3> <div><pre class="text">First, let's consider this HTTP request :

  Line     Contents
  number
     1     GET /serv/login.php?lang=en&amp;profile=2 HTTP/1.1
     2     Host: www.mydomain.com
     3     User-agent: my small browser
     4     Accept: image/jpeg, image/gif
     5     Accept: image/png
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-1.2.1">
<small>1.2.1.</small> The Request line</h4> <div><pre class="text">Line 1 is the "request line". It is always composed of 3 fields :

  - a METHOD      : GET
  - a URI         : /serv/login.php?lang=en&amp;profile=2
  - a version tag : HTTP/1.1

All of them are delimited by what the standard calls LWS (linear white spaces),
which are commonly spaces, but can also be tabs or line feeds/carriage returns
followed by spaces/tabs. The method itself cannot contain any colon (':') and
is limited to alphabetic letters. All those various combinations make it
desirable that HAProxy performs the splitting itself rather than leaving it to
the user to write a complex or inaccurate regular expression.

The URI itself can have several forms :

  - A "relative URI" :

      /serv/login.php?lang=en&amp;profile=2

    It is a complete URL without the host part. This is generally what is
    received by servers, reverse proxies and transparent proxies.

  - An "absolute URI", also called a "URL" :

      http://192.168.0.12:8080/serv/login.php?lang=en&amp;profile=2

    It is composed of a "scheme" (the protocol name followed by '://'), a host
    name or address, optionally a colon (':') followed by a port number, then
    a relative URI beginning at the first slash ('/') after the address part.
    This is generally what proxies receive, but a server supporting HTTP/1.1
    must accept this form too.

  - a star ('*') : this form is only accepted in association with the OPTIONS
    method and is not relayable. It is used to inquiry a next hop's
    capabilities.

  - an address:port combination : 192.168.0.12:80
    This is used with the CONNECT method, which is used to establish TCP
    tunnels through HTTP proxies, generally for HTTPS, but sometimes for
    other protocols too.

In a relative URI, two sub-parts are identified. The part before the question
mark is called the "<a href="#path">path</a>". It is typically the relative path to static objects
on the server. The part after the question mark is called the "query string".
It is mostly used with GET requests sent to dynamic scripts and is very
specific to the language, framework or application in use.

HTTP/2 doesn't convey a version information with the request, so the version is
assumed to be the same as the one of the underlying protocol (i.e. "HTTP/2").
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-1.2.2">
<small>1.2.2.</small> The request headers</h4> <div><pre class="text">The headers start at the second line. They are composed of a name at the
beginning of the line, immediately followed by a colon (':'). Traditionally,
an LWS is added after the colon but that's not required. Then come the values.
Multiple identical headers may be folded into one single line, delimiting the
values with commas, provided that their order is respected. This is commonly
encountered in the "Cookie:" field. A header may span over multiple lines if
the subsequent lines begin with an LWS. In the example in 1.2, lines 4 and 5
define a total of 3 values for the "Accept:" header.

Contrary to a common misconception, header names are not case-sensitive, and
their values are not either if they refer to other header names (such as the
"Connection:" header). In HTTP/2, header names are always sent in lower case,
as can be seen when running in debug mode. Internally, all header names are
normalized to lower case so that HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 use the exact same
representation, and they are sent as-is on the other side. This explains why an
HTTP/1.x request typed with camel case is delivered in lower case.

The end of the headers is indicated by the first empty line. People often say
that it's a double line feed, which is not exact, even if a double line feed
is one valid form of empty line.

Fortunately, HAProxy takes care of all these complex combinations when indexing
headers, checking values and counting them, so there is no reason to worry
about the way they could be written, but it is important not to accuse an
application of being buggy if it does unusual, valid things.

Important note:
   As suggested by RFC7231, HAProxy normalizes headers by replacing line breaks
   in the middle of headers by LWS in order to join multi-line headers. This
   is necessary for proper analysis and helps less capable HTTP parsers to work
   correctly and not to be fooled by such complex constructs.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-1.3">
<small>1.3.</small> HTTP response</h3> <div><pre class="text">An HTTP response looks very much like an HTTP request. Both are called HTTP
messages. Let's consider this HTTP response :

  Line     Contents
  number
     1     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     2     Content-length: 350
     3     Content-Type: text/html

As a special case, HTTP supports so called "Informational responses" as status
codes 1xx. These messages are special in that they don't convey any part of the
response, they're just used as sort of a signaling message to ask a client to
continue to post its request for instance. In the case of a status 100 response
the requested information will be carried by the next non-100 response message
following the informational one. This implies that multiple responses may be
sent to a single request, and that this only works when keep-alive is enabled
(1xx messages are HTTP/1.1 only). HAProxy handles these messages and is able to
correctly forward and skip them, and only process the next non-100 response. As
such, these messages are neither logged nor transformed, unless explicitly
state otherwise. Status 101 messages indicate that the protocol is changing
over the same connection and that HAProxy must switch to tunnel mode, just as
if a CONNECT had occurred. Then the Upgrade header would contain additional
information about the type of protocol the connection is switching to.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-1.3.1">
<small>1.3.1.</small> The response line</h4> <div><pre class="text">Line 1 is the "response line". It is always composed of 3 fields :

  - a version tag : HTTP/1.1
  - a status code : 200
  - a reason      : OK

The status code is always 3-digit. The first digit indicates a general status :
 - 1xx = informational message to be skipped (e.g. 100, 101)
 - 2xx = OK, content is following   (e.g. 200, 206)
 - 3xx = OK, no content following   (e.g. 302, 304)
 - 4xx = error caused by the client (e.g. 401, 403, 404)
 - 5xx = error caused by the server (e.g. 500, 502, 503)

Please refer to RFC7231 for the detailed meaning of all such codes. The
"reason" field is just a hint, but is not parsed by clients. Anything can be
found there, but it's a common practice to respect the well-established
messages. It can be composed of one or multiple words, such as "OK", "Found",
or "Authentication Required".

HAProxy may emit the following status codes by itself :

  Code  When / reason
   200  access to stats page, and when replying to monitoring requests
   301  when performing a redirection, depending on the configured code
   302  when performing a redirection, depending on the configured code
   303  when performing a redirection, depending on the configured code
   307  when performing a redirection, depending on the configured code
   308  when performing a redirection, depending on the configured code
   400  for an invalid or too large request
   401  when an authentication is required to perform the action (when
        accessing the stats page)
   403  when a request is forbidden by a "<a href="#http-request%20deny">http-request deny</a>" rule
   404  when the requested resource could not be found
   408  when the request timeout strikes before the request is complete
   410  when the requested resource is no longer available and will not
        be available again
   500  when HAProxy encounters an unrecoverable internal error, such as a
        memory allocation failure, which should never happen
   501 when HAProxy is unable to satisfy a client request because of an
       unsupported feature
   502  when the server returns an empty, invalid or incomplete response, or
        when an "<a href="#http-response%20deny">http-response deny</a>" rule blocks the response.
   503  when no server was available to handle the request, or in response to
        monitoring requests which match the "<a href="#monitor%20fail">monitor fail</a>" condition
   504  when the response timeout strikes before the server responds

The error 4xx and 5xx codes above may be customized (see "<a href="#errorloc">errorloc</a>" in section
4.2).
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-1.3.2">
<small>1.3.2.</small> The response headers</h4> <div><pre class="text">Response headers work exactly like request headers, and as such, HAProxy uses
the same parsing function for both. Please refer to paragraph 1.2.2 for more
details.
</pre></div>  <h2 id="chapter-2">
<small>2.</small> Configuring HAProxy</h2>  <h3 id="chapter-2.1">
<small>2.1.</small> Configuration file format</h3> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy's configuration process involves 3 major sources of parameters :

  - the arguments from the command-line, which always take precedence
  - the configuration file(s), whose format is described here
  - the running process's environment, in case some environment variables are
    explicitly referenced

The configuration file follows a fairly simple hierarchical format which obey
a few basic rules:

  1. a configuration file is an ordered sequence of statements

  2. a statement is a single non-empty line before any unprotected "#" (hash)

  3. a line is a series of tokens or "words" delimited by unprotected spaces or
     tab characters

  4. the first word or sequence of words of a line is one of the keywords or
     keyword sequences listed in this document

  5. all other words are all arguments of the first one, some being well-known
     keywords listed in this document, others being values, references to other
     parts of the configuration, or expressions

  6. certain keywords delimit a section inside which only a subset of keywords
     are supported

  7. a section ends at the end of a file or on a special keyword starting a new
     section

This is all that is needed to know to write a simple but reliable configuration
generator, but this is not enough to reliably parse any configuration nor to
figure how to deal with certain corner cases.

First, there are a few consequences of the rules above. Rule 6 and 7 imply that
the keywords used to define a new section are valid everywhere and cannot have
a different meaning in a specific section. These keywords are always a single
word (as opposed to a sequence of words), and traditionally the section that
follows them is designated using the same name. For example when speaking about
the "global section", it designates the section of configuration that follows
the "global" keyword. This usage is used a lot in error messages to help locate
the parts that need to be addressed.

A number of sections create an internal object or configuration space, which
requires to be distinguished from other ones. In this case they will take an
extra word which will set the name of this particular section. For some of them
the section name is mandatory. For example "frontend foo" will create a new
section of type "frontend" named "foo". Usually a name is specific to its
section and two sections of different types may use the same name, but this is
not recommended as it tends to complexify configuration management.

A direct consequence of rule 7 is that when multiple files are read at once,
each of them must start with a new section, and the end of each file will end
a section. A file cannot contain sub-sections nor end an existing section and
start a new one.

Rule 1 mentioned that ordering matters. Indeed, some keywords create directives
that can be repeated multiple times to create ordered sequences of rules to be
applied in a certain order. For example "<a href="#tcp-request">tcp-request</a>" can be used to alternate
"accept" and "reject" rules on varying criteria. As such, a configuration file
processor must always preserve a section's ordering when editing a file. The
ordering of sections usually does not matter except for the global section
which must be placed before other sections, but it may be repeated if needed.
In addition, some automatic identifiers may automatically be assigned to some
of the created objects (e.g. proxies), and by reordering sections, their
identifiers will change. These ones appear in the statistics for example. As
such, the configuration below will assign "foo" ID number 1 and "bar" ID number
2, which will be swapped if the two sections are reversed:

     listen foo
         bind :80

     listen bar
         bind :81

Another important point is that according to rules 2 and 3 above, empty lines,
spaces, tabs, and comments following and unprotected "#" character are not part
of the configuration as they are just used as delimiters. This implies that the
following configurations are strictly equivalent:

         global#this is the global section
     daemon#daemonize
         frontend         foo
     mode             http   # or tcp

and:

     global
         daemon

     # this is the public web frontend
     frontend foo
         mode http

The common practice is to align to the left only the keyword that initiates a
new section, and indent (i.e. prepend a tab character or a few spaces) all
other keywords so that it's instantly visible that they belong to the same
section (as done in the second example above). Placing comments before a new
section helps the reader decide if it's the desired one. Leaving a blank line
at the end of a section also visually helps spotting the end when editing it.

Tabs are very convenient for indent but they do not copy-paste well. If spaces
are used instead, it is recommended to avoid placing too many (2 to 4) so that
editing in field doesn't become a burden with limited editors that do not
support automatic indent.

In the early days it used to be common to see arguments split at fixed tab
positions because most keywords would not take more than two arguments. With
modern versions featuring complex expressions this practice does not stand
anymore, and is not recommended.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-2.2">
<small>2.2.</small> Quoting and escaping</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">In modern configurations, some arguments require the use of some characters
that were previously considered as pure delimiters. In order to make this
possible, HAProxy supports character escaping by prepending a backslash ('\')
in front of the character to be escaped, weak quoting within double quotes
('"') and strong quoting within single quotes ("'").

This is pretty similar to what is done in a number of programming languages and
very close to what is commonly encountered in Bourne shell. The principle is
the following: while the configuration parser cuts the lines into words, it
also takes care of quotes and backslashes to decide whether a character is a
delimiter or is the raw representation of this character within the current
word. The escape character is then removed, the quotes are removed, and the
remaining word is used as-is as a keyword or argument for example.

If a backslash is needed in a word, it must either be escaped using itself
(i.e. double backslash) or be strongly quoted.

Escaping outside quotes is achieved by preceding a special character by a
backslash ('\'):

  \    to mark a space and differentiate it from a delimiter
  \#   to mark a hash and differentiate it from a comment
  \\   to use a backslash
  \'   to use a single quote and differentiate it from strong quoting
  \"   to use a double quote and differentiate it from weak quoting

In addition, a few non-printable characters may be emitted using their usual
C-language representation:

  \n   to insert a line feed (LF, character \x0a or ASCII 10 decimal)
  \r   to insert a carriage return (CR, character \x0d or ASCII 13 decimal)
  \t   to insert a tab (character \x09 or ASCII 9 decimal)
  \xNN to insert character having ASCII code hex NN (e.g \x0a for LF).

Weak quoting is achieved by surrounding double quotes ("") around the character
or sequence of characters to protect. Weak quoting prevents the interpretation
of:

       space or tab as a word separator
  '    single quote as a strong quoting delimiter
  #    hash as a comment start

Weak quoting permits the interpretation of environment variables (which are not
evaluated outside of quotes) by preceding them with a dollar sign ('$'). If a
dollar character is needed inside double quotes, it must be escaped using a
backslash.

Strong quoting is achieved by surrounding single quotes ('') around the
character or sequence of characters to protect. Inside single quotes, nothing
is interpreted, it's the efficient way to quote regular expressions.

As a result, here is the matrix indicating how special characters can be
entered in different contexts (unprintable characters are replaced with their
name within angle brackets). Note that some characters that may only be
represented escaped have no possible representation inside single quotes,
hence the '-' there:
</pre>
<table> <thead><tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Unquoted</th>
<th>Weakly quoted</th>
<th>Strongly quoted</th>
</tr></thead> </table>
</div>  <h3 id="chapter-2.3">
<small>2.3.</small> Environment variables</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">HAProxy's configuration supports environment variables. Those variables are
interpreted only within double quotes. Variables are expanded during the
configuration parsing. Variable names must be preceded by a dollar ("$") and
optionally enclosed with braces ("{}") similarly to what is done in Bourne
shell. Variable names can contain alphanumerical characters or the character
underscore ("_") but should not start with a digit. If the variable contains a
list of several values separated by spaces, it can be expanded as individual
arguments by enclosing the variable with braces and appending the suffix '[*]'
before the closing brace.
</pre>
<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example:</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>bind "fd@${FD_APP1}"

log "${LOCAL_SYSLOG}:514" local0 notice   <span class="comment"># send to local server</span>

user "$HAPROXY_USER"
</code></pre> </div>
<pre class="text">Some variables are defined by HAProxy, they can be used in the configuration
file, or could be inherited by a program (See 3.7. Programs):

* HAPROXY_LOCALPEER: defined at the startup of the process which contains the
  name of the local peer. (See "-L" in the management guide.)

* HAPROXY_CFGFILES: list of the configuration files loaded by HAProxy,
  separated by semicolons. Can be useful in the case you specified a
  directory.

* HAPROXY_MWORKER: In master-worker mode, this variable is set to 1.

* HAPROXY_CLI: configured listeners addresses of the stats socket for every
  processes, separated by semicolons.

* HAPROXY_MASTER_CLI: In master-worker mode, listeners addresses of the master
  CLI, separated by semicolons.

In addition, some pseudo-variables are internally resolved and may be used as
regular variables. Pseudo-variables always start with a dot ('.'), and are the
only ones where the dot is permitted. The current list of pseudo-variables is:

* .FILE: the name of the configuration file currently being parsed.

* .LINE: the line number of the configuration file currently being parsed,
  starting at one.

* .SECTION: the name of the section currently being parsed, or its type if the
  section doesn't have a name (e.g. "global"), or an empty string before the
  first section.

These variables are resolved at the location where they are parsed. For example
if a ".LINE" variable is used in a "<a href="#log-format">log-format</a>" directive located in a defaults
section, its line number will be resolved before parsing and compiling the
"<a href="#log-format">log-format</a>" directive, so this same line number will be reused by subsequent
proxies.

This way it is possible to emit information to help locate a rule in variables,
logs, error statuses, health checks, header values, or even to use line numbers
to name some config objects like servers for example.

See also "<a href="#external-check%20command">external-check command</a>" for other variables.

<small>2.4.</small> Conditional blocks</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">It may sometimes be convenient to be able to conditionally enable or disable
some arbitrary parts of the configuration, for example to enable/disable SSL or
ciphers, enable or disable some pre-production listeners without modifying the
configuration, or adjust the configuration's syntax to support two distinct
versions of HAProxy during a migration.. HAProxy brings a set of nestable
preprocessor-like directives which allow to integrate or ignore some blocks of
text. These directives must be placed on their own line and they act on the
lines that follow them. Two of them support an expression, the other ones only
switch to an alternate block or end a current level. The 4 following directives
are defined to form conditional blocks:

  - .if &lt;condition&gt;
  - .elif &lt;condition&gt;
  - .else
  - .endif

The ".if" directive nests a new level, ".elif" stays at the same level, ".else"
as well, and ".endif" closes a level. Each ".if" must be terminated by a
matching ".endif". The ".elif" may only be placed after ".if" or ".elif", and
there is no limit to the number of ".elif" that may be chained. There may be
only one ".else" per ".if" and it must always be after the ".if" or the last
".elif" of a block.

Comments may be placed on the same line if needed after a '#', they will be
ignored. The directives are tokenized like other configuration directives, and
as such it is possible to use environment variables in conditions.

The conditions are currently limited to:

  - an empty string, always returns "false"
  - the integer zero ('0'), always returns "false"
  - a non-nul integer (e.g. '1'), always returns "true".
  - a predicate optionally followed by argument(s) in parenthesis.

The list of currently supported predicates is the following:

  - defined(&lt;name&gt;)       : returns true if an environment variable &lt;name&gt;
                            exists, regardless of its contents

  - feature(&lt;name&gt;)       : returns true if feature &lt;name&gt; is listed as present
                            in the features list reported by "haproxy -vv"
                            (which means a &lt;name&gt; appears after a '+')

  - streq(&lt;str1&gt;,&lt;str2&gt;)  : returns true only if the two strings are equal
  - strneq(&lt;str1&gt;,&lt;str2&gt;) : returns true only if the two strings differ

  - version_atleast(&lt;ver&gt;): returns true if the current haproxy version is
                            at least as recent as &lt;ver&gt; otherwise false. The
                            version syntax is the same as shown by "haproxy -v"
                            and missing components are assumed as being zero.

  - version_before(&lt;ver&gt;) : returns true if the current haproxy version is
                            strictly older than &lt;ver&gt; otherwise false. The
                            version syntax is the same as shown by "haproxy -v"
                            and missing components are assumed as being zero.

<pre class="text">On Linux 2.6 and above, it is possible to bind a process or a thread to a
specific CPU set. This means that the process or the thread will never run on
other CPUs. The "<a href="#cpu-map">cpu-map</a>" directive specifies CPU sets for process or thread
sets. The first argument is a process set, eventually followed by a thread
set. These sets have the format

    all | odd | even | number[-[number]]

&lt;number&gt;&gt; must be a number between 1 and 32 or 64, depending on the machine's
word size. Any process IDs above nbproc and any thread IDs above nbthread are
ignored. It is possible to specify a range with two such number delimited by
a dash ('-'). It also is possible to specify all processes at once using
"all", only odd numbers using "<a href="#odd">odd</a>" or even numbers using "<a href="#even">even</a>", just like
with the "<a href="#bind-process">bind-process</a>" directive. The second and forthcoming arguments are
CPU sets. Each CPU set is either a unique number starting at 0 for the first
CPU or a range with two such numbers delimited by a dash ('-'). Outside of
Linux and BSDs, there may be a limitation on the maximum CPU index to either
31 or 63. Multiple CPU numbers or ranges may be specified, and the processes
or threads will be allowed to bind to all of them. Obviously, multiple
"<a href="#cpu-map">cpu-map</a>" directives may be specified. Each "<a href="#cpu-map">cpu-map</a>" directive will replace
the previous ones when they overlap. A thread will be bound on the
intersection of its mapping and the one of the process on which it is
attached. If the intersection is null, no specific binding will be set for
the thread.

Ranges can be partially defined. The higher bound can be omitted. In such
case, it is replaced by the corresponding maximum value, 32 or 64 depending
on the machine's word size.

The prefix "auto:" can be added before the process set to let HAProxy
automatically bind a process or a thread to a CPU by incrementing
process/thread and CPU sets. To be valid, both sets must have the same
size. No matter the declaration order of the CPU sets, it will be bound from
the lowest to the highest bound. Having a process and a thread range with the
"auto:" prefix is not supported. Only one range is supported, the other one
must be a fixed number.

</div>
<pre class="text">By default HAProxy loads all files designated by a relative path from the
location the process is started in. In some circumstances it might be
desirable to force all relative paths to start from a different location
just as if the process was started from such locations. This is what this
directive is made for. Technically it will perform a temporary chdir() to
the designated location while processing each configuration file, and will
return to the original directory after processing each file. It takes an
argument indicating the policy to use when loading files whose path does
not start with a slash ('/'):
  - "current" indicates that all relative files are to be loaded from the
    directory the process is started in ; this is the default.

  - "config" indicates that all relative files should be loaded from the
    directory containing the configuration file. More specifically, if the
    configuration file contains a slash ('/'), the longest part up to the
    last slash is used as the directory to change to, otherwise the current
    directory is used. This mode is convenient to bundle maps, errorfiles,
    certificates and Lua scripts together as relocatable packages. When
    multiple configuration files are loaded, the directory is updated for
    each of them.

  - "parent" indicates that all relative files should be loaded from the
    parent of the directory containing the configuration file. More
    specifically, if the configuration file contains a slash ('/'), ".."
    is appended to the longest part up to the last slash is used as the
    directory to change to, otherwise the directory is "..". This mode is
    convenient to bundle maps, errorfiles,  certificates and Lua scripts
    together as relocatable packages, but where each part is located in a
    different subdirectory (e.g. "config/", "certs/", "maps/", ...).

  - "origin" indicates that all relative files should be loaded from the
    designated (mandatory) path. This may be used to ease management of
    different HAProxy instances running in parallel on a system, where each
    instance uses a different prefix but where the rest of the sections are
    made easily relocatable.

Each "<a href="#default-path">default-path</a>" directive instantly replaces any previous one and will
possibly result in switching to a different directory. While this should
always result in the desired behavior, it is really not a good practice to
use multiple default-path directives, and if used, the policy ought to remain
consistent across all configuration files.

Warning: some configuration elements such as maps or certificates are
uniquely identified by their configured path. By using a relocatable layout,
it becomes possible for several of them to end up with the same unique name,
making it difficult to update them at run time, especially when multiple
configuration files are loaded from different directories. It is essential to
observe a strict collision-free file naming scheme before adopting relative
paths. A robust approach could consist in prefixing all files names with
their respective site name, or in doing so at the directory level.

There is no standard case for header names because, as stated in RFC7230,
they are case-insensitive. So applications must handle them in a case-
insensitive manner. But some bogus applications violate the standards and
erroneously rely on the cases most commonly used by browsers. This problem
becomes critical with HTTP/2 because all header names must be exchanged in
lower case, and HAProxy follows the same convention. All header names are
sent in lower case to clients and servers, regardless of the HTTP version.

Applications which fail to properly process requests or responses may require
to temporarily use such workarounds to adjust header names sent to them for
the time it takes the application to be fixed. Please note that an
application which requires such workarounds might be vulnerable to content
smuggling attacks and must absolutely be fixed.

<div class="keyword" id="insecure-fork-wanted"><b>insecure-fork-wanted</b></div>
<pre class="text">By default HAProxy tries hard to prevent any thread and process creation
after it starts. Doing so is particularly important when using Lua files of
uncertain origin, and when experimenting with development versions which may
still contain bugs whose exploitability is uncertain. And generally speaking
it's good hygiene to make sure that no unexpected background activity can be
triggered by traffic. But this prevents external checks from working, and may
break some very specific Lua scripts which actively rely on the ability to
fork. This option is there to disable this protection. Note that it is a bad
idea to disable it, as a vulnerability in a library or within HAProxy itself
will be easier to exploit once disabled. In addition, forking from Lua or
anywhere else is not reliable as the forked process may randomly embed a lock
set by another thread and never manage to finish an operation. As such it is
highly recommended that this option is never used and that any workload
requiring such a fork be reconsidered and moved to a safer solution (such as
agents instead of external checks). This option supports the "no" prefix to
disable it.
</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="insecure-setuid-wanted"><b>insecure-setuid-wanted</b></div>
<pre class="text">HAProxy doesn't need to call executables at run time (except when using
external checks which are strongly recommended against), and is even expected
to isolate itself into an empty chroot. As such, there basically is no valid
reason to allow a setuid executable to be called without the user being fully
aware of the risks. In a situation where HAProxy would need to call external
checks and/or disable chroot, exploiting a vulnerability in a library or in
HAProxy itself could lead to the execution of an external program. On Linux
it is possible to lock the process so that any setuid bit present on such an
executable is ignored. This significantly reduces the risk of privilege
escalation in such a situation. This is what HAProxy does by default. In case
this causes a problem to an external check (for example one which would need
the "ping" command), then it is possible to disable this protection by
explicitly adding this directive in the global section. If enabled, it is
possible to turn it back off by prefixing it with the "no" keyword.

<pre class="text">Adds a global syslog server. Several global servers can be defined. They
will receive logs for starts and exits, as well as all logs from proxies
configured with "<span class="dropdown">log global</span>".

&lt;address&gt; can be one of:

      - An IPv4 address optionally followed by a colon and a UDP port. If
        no port is specified, 514 is used by default (the standard syslog
        port).

      - An IPv6 address followed by a colon and optionally a UDP port. If
        no port is specified, 514 is used by default (the standard syslog
        port).

      - A filesystem path to a datagram UNIX domain socket, keeping in mind
        considerations for chroot (be sure the path is accessible inside
        the chroot) and uid/gid (be sure the path is appropriately
        writable).

      - A file descriptor number in the form "fd@&lt;number&gt;", which may point
        to a pipe, terminal, or socket. In this case unbuffered logs are used
        and one writev() call per log is performed. This is a bit expensive
        but acceptable for most workloads. Messages sent this way will not be
        truncated but may be dropped, in which case the DroppedLogs counter
        will be incremented. The writev() call is atomic even on pipes for
        messages up to PIPE_BUF size, which POSIX recommends to be at least
        512 and which is 4096 bytes on most modern operating systems. Any
        larger message may be interleaved with messages from other processes.
        Exceptionally for debugging purposes the file descriptor may also be
        directed to a file, but doing so will significantly slow HAProxy down
        as non-blocking calls will be ignored. Also there will be no way to
        purge nor rotate this file without restarting the process. Note that
        the configured syslog format is preserved, so the output is suitable
        for use with a TCP syslog server. See also the "short" and "raw"
        format below.

      - "stdout" / "stderr", which are respectively aliases for "fd@1" and
        "fd@2", see above.

      - A ring buffer in the form "ring@&lt;name&gt;", which will correspond to an
        in-memory ring buffer accessible over the CLI using the "show events"
        command, which will also list existing rings and their sizes. Such
        buffers are lost on reload or restart but when used as a complement
        this can help troubleshooting by having the logs instantly available.

      You may want to reference some environment variables in the address
      parameter, see <a href="#2.3">section 2.3</a> about environment variables.

&lt;length&gt; is an optional maximum line length. Log lines larger than this value
         will be truncated before being sent. The reason is that syslog
         servers act differently on log line length. All servers support the
         default value of 1024, but some servers simply drop larger lines
         while others do log them. If a server supports long lines, it may
         make sense to set this value here in order to avoid truncating long
         lines. Similarly, if a server drops long lines, it is preferable to
         truncate them before sending them. Accepted values are 80 to 65535
         inclusive. The default value of 1024 is generally fine for all
         standard usages. Some specific cases of long captures or
         JSON-formatted logs may require larger values. You may also need to
         increase "<a href="#tune.http.logurilen">tune.http.logurilen</a>" if your request URIs are truncated.

&lt;format&gt; is the log format used when generating syslog messages. It may be
         one of the following :

  local     Analog to rfc3164 syslog message format except that hostname
            field is stripped. This is the default.
            Note: option "<a href="#log-send-hostname">log-send-hostname</a>" switches the default to
            rfc3164.

  rfc3164   The RFC3164 syslog message format.
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164)

  rfc5424   The RFC5424 syslog message format.
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424)

  priority  A message containing only a level plus syslog facility between
            angle brackets such as '&lt;63&gt;', followed by the text. The PID,
            date, time, process name and system name are omitted. This is
            designed to be used with a local log server.

  short     A message containing only a level between angle brackets such as
            '&lt;3&gt;', followed by the text. The PID, date, time, process name
            and system name are omitted. This is designed to be used with a
            local log server. This format is compatible with what the systemd
            logger consumes.

  timed     A message containing only a level between angle brackets such as
           '&lt;3&gt;', followed by ISO date and by the text. The PID, process
            name and system name are omitted. This is designed to be
            used with a local log server.

  iso       A message containing only the ISO date, followed by the text.
            The PID, process name and system name are omitted. This is
            designed to be used with a local log server.

  raw       A message containing only the text. The level, PID, date, time,
            process name and system name are omitted. This is designed to be
            used in containers or during development, where the severity only
            depends on the file descriptor used (stdout/stderr).

&lt;ranges&gt;   A list of comma-separated ranges to identify the logs to sample.
           This is used to balance the load of the logs to send to the log
           server. The limits of the ranges cannot be null. They are numbered
           from 1. The size or period (in number of logs) of the sample must be
           set with &lt;sample_size&gt; parameter.

&lt;sample_size&gt;
           The size of the sample in number of logs to consider when balancing
           their logging loads. It is used to balance the load of the logs to
           send to the syslog server. This size must be greater or equal to the
           maximum of the high limits of the ranges.
           (see also &lt;ranges&gt; parameter).

&lt;facility&gt; must be one of the 24 standard syslog facilities :

               kern   user   mail   daemon auth   syslog lpr    news
               uucp   cron   auth2  ftp    ntp    audit  alert  cron2
               local0 local1 local2 local3 local4 local5 local6 local7

           Note that the facility is ignored for the "short" and "raw"
           formats, but still required as a positional field. It is
           recommended to use "<a href="#daemon">daemon</a>" in this case to make it clear that
           it's only supposed to be used locally.

An optional level can be specified to filter outgoing messages. By default,
all messages are sent. If a maximum level is specified, only messages with a
severity at least as important as this level will be sent. An optional minimum
level can be specified. If it is set, logs emitted with a more severe level
than this one will be capped to this level. This is used to avoid sending
"emerg" messages on all terminals on some default syslog configurations.
Eight levels are known :

        emerg  alert  crit   err    warning notice info  debug

figure what thread is being initialized. Programs loaded this way will run
concurrently on all threads and will be highly scalable. This is the
recommended way to load simple functions that register sample-fetches,
converters, actions or services once it is certain the program doesn't depend

will be checked earlier.

As an example by specifying the following path:

  lua-prepend-path /usr/share/haproxy-lua/?/init.lua
  lua-prepend-path /usr/share/haproxy-lua/?.lua

When `require "example"` is being called Lua will first attempt to load the

or daemon mode. It is recommended to use this mode with multiprocess and
systemd.
By default, if a worker exits with a bad return code, in the case of a
segfault for example, all workers will be killed, and the master will leave.
It is convenient to combine this behavior with Restart=on-failure in a
systemd unit file in order to relaunch the whole process. If you don't want
this behavior, you must use the keyword "no-exit-on-failure".

the current directory's permissions (check what directory the file is started

or any other system-specific constraint. For example, some Linux flavours are
notorious for replacing the default core file with a path to an executable

simply writing "core", "core.%p" or "/var/log/core/core.%p" addresses the

associated to "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" lines as well as "<span class="dropdown">server</span>" lines but some of the extra
files will not have any functional impact for "<span class="dropdown">server</span>" line certificates.

By default, HAProxy discovers automatically a lot of files not specified in
the configuration, and you may want to disable this behavior if you want to
optimize the startup time.

"none": Only load the files specified in the configuration. Don't try to load
a certificate bundle if the file does not exist. In the case of a directory,
it won't try to bundle the certificates if they have the same basename.

"all": This is the default behavior, it will try to load everything,
bundles, sctl, ocsp, issuer, key.

"bundle": When a file specified in the configuration does not exist, HAProxy
will try to load a "cert bundle". Certificate bundles are only managed on the
frontend side and will not work for backend certificates.

Starting from HAProxy 2.3, the bundles are not loaded in the same OpenSSL
certificate store, instead it will loads each certificate in a separate
store which is equivalent to declaring multiple "<span class="dropdown">crt</span>". OpenSSL 1.1.1 is
required to achieve this. Which means that bundles are now used only for
backward compatibility and are not mandatory anymore to do an hybrid RSA/ECC
bind configuration.

To associate these PEM files into a "cert bundle" that is recognized by
HAProxy, they must be named in the following way: All PEM files that are to
be bundled must have the same base name, with a suffix indicating the key
type. Currently, three suffixes are supported: rsa, dsa and ecdsa. For
example, if www.example.com has two PEM files, an RSA file and an ECDSA
file, they must be named: "example.pem.rsa" and "example.pem.ecdsa". The
first part of the filename is arbitrary; only the suffix matters. To load
this bundle into HAProxy, specify the base name only:
</pre>
<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example :</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>bind :8443 ssl crt example.pem
</code></pre> </div>
<pre class="text">Note that the suffix is not given to HAProxy; this tells HAProxy to look for
a cert bundle.

HAProxy will load all PEM files in the bundle as if they were configured
separately in several "<span class="dropdown">crt</span>".

The bundle loading does not have an impact anymore on the directory loading
since files are loading separately.

On the CLI, bundles are seen as separate files, and the bundle extension is
required to commit them.

OCSP files (.ocsp), issuer files (.issuer), Certificate Transparency (.sctl)
as well as private keys (.key) are supported with multi-cert bundling.

"sctl": Try to load "&lt;basename&gt;.sctl" for each crt keyword. If provided for
a backend certificate, it will be loaded but will not have any functional
impact.

"ocsp": Try to load "&lt;basename&gt;.ocsp" for each crt keyword. If provided for
a backend certificate, it will be loaded but will not have any functional
impact.

"issuer": Try to load "&lt;basename&gt;.issuer" if the issuer of the OCSP file is
not provided in the PEM file. If provided for a backend certificate, it will
be loaded but will not have any functional impact.

"key": If the private key was not provided by the PEM file, try to load a
file "&lt;basename&gt;.key" containing a private key.

The default behavior is "all".

<div class="keyword" id="busy-polling"><b>busy-polling</b></div>
<pre class="text">In some situations, especially when dealing with low latency on processors
supporting a variable frequency or when running inside virtual machines, each
time the process waits for an I/O using the poller, the processor goes back
to sleep or is offered to another VM for a long time, and it causes
excessively high latencies. This option provides a solution preventing the
processor from sleeping by always using a null timeout on the pollers. This
results in a significant latency reduction (30 to 100 microseconds observed)
at the expense of a risk to overheat the processor. It may even be used with
threads, in which case improperly bound threads may heavily conflict,
resulting in a worse performance and high values for the CPU stolen fields
in "show info" output, indicating which threads are misconfigured. It is
important not to let the process run on the same processor as the network
interrupts when this option is used. It is also better to avoid using it on
multiple CPU threads sharing the same core. This option is disabled by
default. If it has been enabled, it may still be forcibly disabled by
prefixing it with the "no" keyword. It is ignored by the "select" and

to avoid hammering services running on the same server. But when using large

time before starting to be tested, which can be a problem. This parameter is
used to enforce an upper bound on delay between the first and the last check,
even if the servers' check intervals are larger. When servers run with
shorter intervals, their intervals will be respected though.

the "select" poller cannot reliably use more than 1024 file descriptors on
some platforms. If your platform only supports select and reports "select

below 500 in general). If this value is not set, it will automatically be

case of multiple processes (nbproc &gt; 1), each process manages its individual

avoids having openssl use too much memory and crash when malloc returns NULL
(since it unfortunately does not reliably check for such conditions). Note
that the limit applies both to incoming and outgoing connections, so one
connection which is deciphered then ciphered accounts for 2 SSL connections.
If this value is not set, but a memory limit is enforced, this value will be
automatically computed based on the memory limit, maxconn,  the buffer size,
memory allocated to compression, SSL cache size, and use of SSL in either
frontends, backends or both. If neither maxconn nor maxsslconn are specified
when there is a memory limit, HAProxy will automatically adjust these values
so that 100% of the connections can be made over SSL with no risk, and will

systems, containers, or virtual machines, or when the system swaps (which
must absolutely never happen on a load balancer).

CPU profiling per task can be very convenient to report where the time is
spent and which requests have what effect on which other request. Enabling
it will typically affect the overall's performance by less than 1%, thus it
is recommended to leave it to the default 'auto' value so that it only
operates when a problem is identified. This feature requires a system

The default value is zero which means unlimited. The minimum non-zero value

limit the amount of memory a process may take, while retaining a sane
behavior. When this limit is reached, sessions which need a buffer wait for
another one to be released by another session. Since buffers are dynamically
allocated and released, the waiting time is very short and not perceptible
provided that limits remain reasonable. In fact sometimes reducing the limit
may even increase performance by increasing the CPU cache's efficiency. Tests
have shown good results on average HTTP traffic with a limit to 1/10 of the
expected global maxconn setting, which also significantly reduces memory
usage. The memory savings come from the fact that a number of connections

possibly causing the system to run out of memory. At least the global maxconn
parameter should be decreased by the same factor as this one is increased. In
addition, use of HTTP/2 mandates that this value must be 16384 or more. If an
HTTP request is larger than (tune.bufsize - tune.maxrewrite), HAProxy will

<pre class="text">Sets the HTTP/2 dynamic header table size. It defaults to 4096 bytes and
cannot be larger than 65536 bytes. A larger value may help certain clients
send more compact requests, depending on their capabilities. This amount of

<pre class="text">Sets the HTTP/2 initial window size, which is the number of bytes the client
can upload before waiting for an acknowledgment from HAProxy. This setting
only affects payload contents (i.e. the body of POST requests), not headers.
The default value is 65535, which roughly allows up to 5 Mbps of upload
bandwidth per client over a network showing a 100 ms ping time, or 500 Mbps
over a 1-ms local network. It can make sense to increase this value to allow
faster uploads, or to reduce it to increase fairness when dealing with many

<pre class="text">Sets the HTTP/2 maximum number of concurrent streams per connection (ie the
number of outstanding requests on a single connection). The default value is
100. A larger one may slightly improve page load time for complex sites when
visited over high latency networks, but increases the amount of resources a
single client may allocate. A value of zero disables the limit so a single
client may create as many streams as allocatable by HAProxy. It is highly
recommended not to change this value.

receive to its peers. The default value is the largest between 16384 and the
buffer size (tune.bufsize). In any case, HAProxy will not announce support
for frame sizes larger than buffers. The main purpose of this setting is to
allow to limit the maximum frame size setting when using large buffers. Too
large frame sizes might have performance impact or cause some peers to
misbehave. It is highly recommended not to change this value.

high a value because all cookie captures still allocate this size whatever
their configured value (they share a same pool). This value is per request

number of headers greater than this value (including the first line), it is
rejected with a "400 Bad Request" status code. Similarly, too large responses
are blocked with "502 Bad Gateway". The default value is 101, which is enough
for all usages, considering that the widely deployed Apache server uses the
same limit. It can be useful to push this limit further to temporarily allow
a buggy application to work by the time it gets fixed. The accepted range is
1..32767. Keep in mind that each new header consumes 32bits of memory for
each session, so don't push this limit too high.

order to minimize the number of persistent connections to a server, and to
optimize the connection reuse rate. But to help with debugging or when
suspecting a bug in HAProxy around connection reuse, it can be convenient to
forcefully disable this idle pool sharing between multiple threads, and force
this option to "off". The default is on. It is strongly recommended against
disabling this option without setting a conservative value on "<a href="#pool-low-conn">pool-low-conn</a>"

some packet sizes while forwarding large and small data alternatively. The
decision to use splice() or to send large buffers in SSL is modulated by this
parameter. The value is in milliseconds between 0 and 65535. A value of zero
means that HAProxy will not try to detect idle streams. The default is 1000,
which seems to correctly detect end user pauses (e.g. read a page before

used to give better performance at high connection rates, though this is not
the case anymore with the multi-queue. This value applies individually to
each listener, so that the number of processes a listener is bound to is
taken into account. This value defaults to 4 which showed best results. If a
significantly higher value was inherited from an ancient config, it might be
worth removing it as it will both increase performance and lower response
time. In multi-process mode, it is divided by twice the number of processes
the listener is bound to. Setting this value to -1 completely disables the

used for header rewriting or appending. The first reads on sockets will never
fill more than bufsize-maxrewrite. Historically it has defaulted to half of
bufsize, though that does not make much sense since there are rarely large
numbers of headers to add. Setting it too high prevents processing of large
requests or responses. Setting it too low prevents addition of new headers
to already large requests or to POST requests. It is generally wise to set it
to about 1024. It is automatically readjusted to half of bufsize if it is

and maps on slow pattern lookups, namely the ones using the "<a href="#sub">sub</a>", "reg",
"dir", "dom", "end", "<a href="#bin">bin</a>" match methods as well as the case-insensitive
strings. It applies to pattern expressions which means that it will be able
to memorize the result of a lookup among all the patterns specified on a
configuration line (including all those loaded from files). It automatically
invalidates entries which are updated using HTTP actions or on the CLI. The
default cache size is set to 10000 entries, which limits its footprint to
about 5 MB per process/thread on 32-bit systems and 8 MB per process/thread
on 64-bit systems, as caches are thread/process local. There is a very low
risk of collision in this cache, which is in the order of the size of the
cache divided by 2^64. Typically, at 10000 requests per second with the
default cache size of 10000 entries, there's 1% chance that a brute force
attack could cause a single collision after 60 years, or 0.1% after 6 years.
This is considered much lower than the risk of a memory corruption caused by
aging components. If this is not acceptable, the cache can be disabled by
setting this parameter to 0.

Increasing it may incur latency when dealing with I/Os, making it too small
can incur extra overhead. Higher thread counts benefit from lower values.
When experimenting with much larger values, it may be useful to also enable

HAProxy processes tasks from several classes one class at a time as this is
the most efficient. But when running with large values of tune.runqueue-depth
this can have a measurable effect on request or connection latency. When this
low-latency setting is enabled, tasks of lower priority classes will always
be executed before other ones if they exist. This will permit to lower the
maximum latency experienced by new requests or connections in the middle of
massive traffic, at the expense of a higher impact on this large traffic.
For regular usage it is better to leave this off. The default value is off.

The ClientRandom is provided by the %[ssl_fc_client_random,hex] sample

limits the memory for each request or response processing.
Memory accounting is hierarchical, meaning more coarse grained limits include
the finer grained ones: "<a href="#proc">proc</a>" includes "sess", "sess" includes "txn", and

<pre class="text">Adds user &lt;username&gt; to the current userlist. Both secure (encrypted) and

evaluated using the crypt(3) function, so depending on the system's
capabilities, different algorithms are supported. For example, modern Glibc
based Linux systems support MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512, and, of course, the
classic DES-based method of encrypting passwords.

Attention: Be aware that using encrypted passwords might cause significantly
increased CPU usage, depending on the number of requests, and the algorithm
used. For any of the hashed variants, the password for each request must
be processed through the chosen algorithm, before it can be compared to the
value specified in the config file. Most current algorithms are deliberately
designed to be expensive to compute to achieve resistance against brute
force attacks. They do not simply salt/hash the clear text password once,
but thousands of times. This can quickly become a major factor in HAProxy's
overall CPU consumption!

<small>3.5.</small> Peers</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">It is possible to propagate entries of any data-types in stick-tables between
several HAProxy instances over TCP connections in a multi-master fashion. Each
instance pushes its local updates and insertions to remote peers. The pushed
values overwrite remote ones without aggregation. Interrupted exchanges are
automatically detected and recovered from the last known point.
In addition, during a soft restart, the old process connects to the new one
using such a TCP connection to push all its entries before the new process
tries to connect to other peers. That ensures very fast replication during a
reload, it typically takes a fraction of a second even for large tables.
Note that Server IDs are used to identify servers remotely, so it is important
that configurations look similar or at least that the same IDs are forced on
each server on all participants.

If &lt;peername&gt; is set to the local peer name (by default hostname, or forced

HAProxy will listen for incoming remote peer connection on &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;.
Otherwise, &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt; defines where to connect to in order to join the
remote peer, and &lt;peername&gt; is used at the protocol level to identify and
validate the remote peer on the server side.

During a soft restart, local peer &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt; is used by the old instance to
connect the new one and initiate a complete replication (teaching process).

It is strongly recommended to have the exact same peers declaration on all
peers and to only rely on the "-L" command line argument or the "<a href="#localpeer">localpeer</a>"
global configuration setting to change the local peer name. This makes it
easier to maintain coherent configuration files across all peers.

exactly the same way as the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" keyword in others section, except
for the "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" argument which is not required here and with an additional
mandatory first parameter to designate the stick-table. Contrary to others
sections, there may be several "<a href="#table">table</a>" lines in "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" sections (see also
"<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" keyword).

Also be aware of the fact that "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" sections have their own stick-table
namespaces to avoid collisions between stick-table names identical in
different "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" section. This is internally handled prepending the "<a href="#peers">peers</a>"
sections names to the name of the stick-tables followed by a '/' character.
If somewhere else in the configuration file you have to refer to such
stick-tables declared in "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" sections you must use the prefixed version
of the stick-table name as follows:

    peers mypeers
        peer A ...
        peer B ...
        table t1 ...

    frontend fe1
        tcp-request content track-sc0 src table mypeers/t1

This is also this prefixed version of the stick-table names which must be
used to refer to stick-tables through the CLI.

About "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" protocol, as only "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" belonging to the same section may
communicate with each others, there is no need to do such a distinction.
Several "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" sections may declare stick-tables with the same name.
This is shorter version of the stick-table name  which is sent over the network.
There is only a '/' character as prefix to avoid stick-table name collisions between
stick-tables declared as backends and stick-table declared in "<a href="#peers">peers</a>" sections
as follows in this weird but supported configuration:

    peers mypeers
        peer A ...
        peer B ...
        table t1 type string size 10m store gpc0

    backend t1
        stick-table type string size 10m store gpc0 peers mypeers

Here "t1" table declared in "mypeers" section has "mypeers/t1" as global name.
"t1" table declared as a backend as "t1" as global name. But at peer protocol
level the former table is named "/t1", the latter is again named "t1".

attach multiple servers to the same ring. Note that specific server directive
"<a href="#log-proto">log-proto</a>" is used to set the protocol used to send messages.

<small>4.</small> Proxies</h2> <div><pre class="text">Proxy configuration can be located in a set of sections :
 - defaults [&lt;name&gt;] [ from &lt;defaults_name&gt; ]
 - frontend &lt;name&gt;   [ from &lt;defaults_name&gt; ]
 - backend  &lt;name&gt;   [ from &lt;defaults_name&gt; ]
 - listen   &lt;name&gt;   [ from &lt;defaults_name&gt; ]

A "frontend" section describes a set of listening sockets accepting client
connections.

A "backend" section describes a set of servers to which the proxy will connect
to forward incoming connections.

A "listen" section defines a complete proxy with its frontend and backend
parts combined in one section. It is generally useful for TCP-only traffic.

A "defaults" section resets all settings to the documented ones and presets new
ones for use by subsequent sections. All of "frontend", "backend" and "listen"
sections always take their initial settings from a defaults section, by default
the latest one that appears before the newly created section. It is possible to
explicitly designate a specific "defaults" section to load the initial settings
from by indicating its name on the section line after the optional keyword
"from". While "defaults" section do not impose a name, this use is encouraged
for better readability. It is also the only way to designate a specific section
to use instead of the default previous one. Since "defaults" section names are
optional, by default a very permissive check is applied on their name and these
are even permitted to overlap. However if a "defaults" section is referenced by
any other section, its name must comply with the syntax imposed on all proxy
names, and this name must be unique among the defaults sections. Please note
that regardless of what is currently permitted, it is recommended to avoid
duplicate section names in general and to respect the same syntax as for proxy
names. This rule might be enforced in a future version.

Note that it is even possible for a defaults section to take its initial
settings from another one, and as such, inherit settings across multiple levels
of defaults sections. This can be convenient to establish certain configuration
profiles to carry groups of default settings (e.g. TCP vs HTTP or short vs long
timeouts) but can quickly become confusing to follow.

All proxy names must be formed from upper and lower case letters, digits,
'-' (dash), '_' (underscore) , '.' (dot) and ':' (colon). ACL names are
case-sensitive, which means that "www" and "WWW" are two different proxies.

Historically, all proxy names could overlap, it just caused troubles in the
logs. Since the introduction of content switching, it is mandatory that two
proxies with overlapping capabilities (frontend/backend) have different names.
However, it is still permitted that a frontend and a backend share the same
name, as this configuration seems to be commonly encountered.

Right now, two major proxy modes are supported : "tcp", also known as layer 4,
and "http", also known as layer 7. In layer 4 mode, HAProxy simply forwards
bidirectional traffic between two sides. In layer 7 mode, HAProxy analyzes the
protocol, and can interact with it by allowing, blocking, switching, adding,
modifying, or removing arbitrary contents in requests or responses, based on
arbitrary criteria.

In HTTP mode, the processing applied to requests and responses flowing over
a connection depends in the combination of the frontend's HTTP options and
the backend's. HAProxy supports 3 connection modes :

  - KAL : keep alive ("<a href="#option%20http-keep-alive">option http-keep-alive</a>") which is the default mode : all
    requests and responses are processed, and connections remain open but idle
    between responses and new requests.

  - SCL: server close ("<a href="#option%20http-server-close">option http-server-close</a>") : the server-facing
    connection is closed after the end of the response is received, but the
    client-facing connection remains open.

  - CLO: close ("<a href="#option%20httpclose">option httpclose</a>"): the connection is closed after the end of
    the response and "Connection: close" appended in both directions.

The effective mode that will be applied to a connection passing through a
frontend and a backend can be determined by both proxy modes according to the
following matrix, but in short, the modes are symmetric, keep-alive is the
weakest option and close is the strongest.

                   Backend mode

                | KAL | SCL | CLO
            ----+-----+-----+----
            KAL | KAL | SCL | CLO
            ----+-----+-----+----
   mode     SCL | SCL | SCL | CLO
            ----+-----+-----+----
            CLO | CLO | CLO | CLO

It is possible to chain a TCP frontend to an HTTP backend. It is pointless if
only HTTP traffic is handled. But it may be used to handle several protocols
within the same frontend. In this case, the client's connection is first handled
as a raw tcp connection before being upgraded to HTTP. Before the upgrade, the
content processings are performend on raw data. Once upgraded, data is parsed
and stored using an internal representation called HTX and it is no longer
possible to rely on raw representation. There is no way to go back.

There are two kind of upgrades, in-place upgrades and destructive upgrades. The
first ones involves a TCP to HTTP/1 upgrade. In HTTP/1, the request
processings are serialized, thus the applicative stream can be preserved. The
second one involves a TCP to HTTP/2 upgrade. Because it is a multiplexed
protocol, the applicative stream cannot be associated to any HTTP/2 stream and
is destroyed. New applicative streams are then created when HAProxy receives
new HTTP/2 streams at the lower level, in the H2 multiplexer. It is important
to understand this difference because that drastically changes the way to
process data. When an HTTP/1 upgrade is performed, the content processings
already performed on raw data are neither lost nor reexecuted while for an
HTTP/2 upgrade, applicative streams are distinct and all frontend rules are
evaluated systematically on each one. And as said, the first stream, the TCP
one, is destroyed, but only after the frontend rules were evaluated.

There is another importnat point to understand when HTTP processings are
performed from a TCP proxy. While HAProxy is able to parse HTTP/1 in-fly from
tcp-request content rules, it is not possible for HTTP/2. Only the HTTP/2
preface can be parsed. This is a huge limitation regarding the HTTP content
analysis in TCP. Concretely it is only possible to know if received data are
HTTP. For instance, it is not possible to choose a backend based on the Host
header value while it is trivial in HTTP/1. Hopefully, there is a solution to
mitigate this drawback.

There are two ways to perform an HTTP upgrade. The first one, the historical
method, is to select an HTTP backend. The upgrade happens when the backend is
set. Thus, for in-place upgrades, only the backend configuration is considered
in the HTTP data processing. For destructive upgrades, the applicative stream
is destroyed, thus its processing is stopped. With this method, possibilities
to choose a backend with an HTTP/2 connection are really limited, as mentioned
above, and a bit useless because the stream is destroyed. The second method is
to upgrade during the tcp-request content rules evaluation, thanks to the
"switch-mode http" action. In this case, the upgrade is performed in the
frontend context and it is possible to define HTTP directives in this
frontend. For in-place upgrades, it offers all the power of the HTTP analysis
as soon as possible. It is not that far from an HTTP frontend. For destructive
upgrades, it does not change anything except it is useless to choose a backend
on limited information. It is of course the recommended method. Thus, testing
the request protocol from the tcp-request content rules to perform an HTTP
upgrade is enough. All the remaining HTTP manipulation may be moved to the
frontend http-request ruleset. But keep in mind that tcp-request content rules
remains evaluated on each streams, that can't be changed.

<small>4.1.</small> Proxy keywords matrix</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">The following list of keywords is supported. Most of them may only be used in a
limited set of section types. Some of them are marked as "deprecated" because
they are inherited from an old syntax which may be confusing or functionally
limited, and there are new recommended keywords to replace them. Keywords
marked with "(*)" can be optionally inverted using the "no" prefix, e.g. "no
option contstats". This makes sense when the option has been enabled by default
and must be disabled for a specific instance. Such options may also be prefixed
with "default" in order to restore default settings regardless of what has been
specified in a previous "defaults" section.

the system's SYN backlog size. Depending on the system, sometimes it is just
tunable via a system parameter, sometimes it is not adjustable at all, and
sometimes the system relies on hints given by the application at the time of
the listen() syscall. By default, HAProxy passes the frontend's maxconn value
to the listen() syscall. On systems which can make use of this value, it can
sometimes be useful to be able to specify a different value, hence this
backlog parameter.

On Linux 2.4, the parameter is ignored by the system. On Linux 2.6, it is
used as a hint and the system accepts up to the smallest greater power of
two, and never more than some limits (usually 32768).

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span><pre class="prettyprint arguments">&lt;algorithm&gt; is the algorithm used to select a server when doing load
            balancing. This only applies when no persistence information
            is available, or when a connection is redispatched to another
            server. &lt;algorithm&gt; may be one of the following :

  roundrobin  Each server is used in turns, according to their weights.
              This is the smoothest and fairest algorithm when the server's
              processing time remains equally distributed. This algorithm
              is dynamic, which means that server weights may be adjusted
              on the fly for slow starts for instance. It is limited by
              design to 4095 active servers per backend. Note that in some
              large farms, when a server becomes up after having been down
              for a very short time, it may sometimes take a few hundreds
              requests for it to be re-integrated into the farm and start
              receiving traffic. This is normal, though very rare. It is
              indicated here in case you would have the chance to observe
              it, so that you don't worry.

  static-rr   Each server is used in turns, according to their weights.
              This algorithm is as similar to roundrobin except that it is
              static, which means that changing a server's weight on the
              fly will have no effect. On the other hand, it has no design
              limitation on the number of servers, and when a server goes
              up, it is always immediately reintroduced into the farm, once
              the full map is recomputed. It also uses slightly less CPU to
              run (around -1%).

  leastconn   The server with the lowest number of connections receives the
              connection. Round-robin is performed within groups of servers
              of the same load to ensure that all servers will be used. Use
              of this algorithm is recommended where very long sessions are
              expected, such as LDAP, SQL, TSE, etc... but is not very well
              suited for protocols using short sessions such as HTTP. This
              algorithm is dynamic, which means that server weights may be
              adjusted on the fly for slow starts for instance. It will
              also consider the number of queued connections in addition to
              the established ones in order to minimize queuing.

  first       The first server with available connection slots receives the
              connection. The servers are chosen from the lowest numeric
              identifier to the highest (see server parameter "<span class="dropdown">id</span>"), which
              defaults to the server's position in the farm. Once a server
              reaches its maxconn value, the next server is used. It does
              not make sense to use this algorithm without setting maxconn.
              The purpose of this algorithm is to always use the smallest
              number of servers so that extra servers can be powered off
              during non-intensive hours. This algorithm ignores the server
              weight, and brings more benefit to long session such as RDP
              or IMAP than HTTP, though it can be useful there too. In
              order to use this algorithm efficiently, it is recommended
              that a cloud controller regularly checks server usage to turn
              them off when unused, and regularly checks backend queue to
              turn new servers on when the queue inflates. Alternatively,
              using "<a href="#http-check%20send-state">http-check send-state</a>" may inform servers on the load.

  source      The source IP address is hashed and divided by the total
              weight of the running servers to designate which server will
              receive the request. This ensures that the same client IP
              address will always reach the same server as long as no
              server goes down or up. If the hash result changes due to the
              number of running servers changing, many clients will be
              directed to a different server. This algorithm is generally
              used in TCP mode where no cookie may be inserted. It may also
              be used on the Internet to provide a best-effort stickiness
              to clients which refuse session cookies. This algorithm is
              static by default, which means that changing a server's
              weight on the fly will have no effect, but this can be
              changed using "<a href="#hash-type">hash-type</a>".

  uri         This algorithm hashes either the left part of the URI (before
              the question mark) or the whole URI (if the "whole" parameter
              is present) and divides the hash value by the total weight of
              the running servers. The result designates which server will
              receive the request. This ensures that the same URI will
              always be directed to the same server as long as no server
              goes up or down. This is used with proxy caches and
              anti-virus proxies in order to maximize the cache hit rate.
              Note that this algorithm may only be used in an HTTP backend.
              This algorithm is static by default, which means that
              changing a server's weight on the fly will have no effect,
              but this can be changed using "<a href="#hash-type">hash-type</a>".

              This algorithm supports two optional parameters "len" and
              "depth", both followed by a positive integer number. These
              options may be helpful when it is needed to balance servers
              based on the beginning of the URI only. The "len" parameter
              indicates that the algorithm should only consider that many
              characters at the beginning of the URI to compute the hash.
              Note that having "len" set to 1 rarely makes sense since most
              URIs start with a leading "/".

              The "depth" parameter indicates the maximum directory depth
              to be used to compute the hash. One level is counted for each
              slash in the request. If both parameters are specified, the
              evaluation stops when either is reached.

              A "path-only" parameter indicates that the hashing key starts
              at the first '/' of the path. This can be used to ignore the
              authority part of absolute URIs, and to make sure that HTTP/1
              and HTTP/2 URIs will provide the same hash.

  url_param   The URL parameter specified in argument will be looked up in
              the query string of each HTTP GET request.

              If the modifier "check_post" is used, then an HTTP POST
              request entity will be searched for the parameter argument,
              when it is not found in a query string after a question mark
              ('?') in the URL. The message body will only start to be
              analyzed once either the advertised amount of data has been
              received or the request buffer is full. In the unlikely event
              that chunked encoding is used, only the first chunk is
              scanned. Parameter values separated by a chunk boundary, may
              be randomly balanced if at all. This keyword used to support
              an optional &lt;max_wait&gt; parameter which is now ignored.

              If the parameter is found followed by an equal sign ('=') and
              a value, then the value is hashed and divided by the total
              weight of the running servers. The result designates which
              server will receive the request.

              This is used to track user identifiers in requests and ensure
              that a same user ID will always be sent to the same server as
              long as no server goes up or down. If no value is found or if
              the parameter is not found, then a round robin algorithm is
              applied. Note that this algorithm may only be used in an HTTP
              backend. This algorithm is static by default, which means
              that changing a server's weight on the fly will have no
              effect, but this can be changed using "<a href="#hash-type">hash-type</a>".

  hdr(&lt;name&gt;) The HTTP header &lt;name&gt; will be looked up in each HTTP
              request. Just as with the equivalent ACL 'hdr()' function,
              the header name in parenthesis is not case sensitive. If the
              header is absent or if it does not contain any value, the
              roundrobin algorithm is applied instead.

              An optional 'use_domain_only' parameter is available, for
              reducing the hash algorithm to the main domain part with some
              specific headers such as 'Host'. For instance, in the Host
              value "haproxy.1wt.eu", only "1wt" will be considered.

              This algorithm is static by default, which means that
              changing a server's weight on the fly will have no effect,
              but this can be changed using "<a href="#hash-type">hash-type</a>".

  random
  random(&lt;draws&gt;)
              A random number will be used as the key for the consistent
              hashing function. This means that the servers' weights are
              respected, dynamic weight changes immediately take effect, as
              well as new server additions. Random load balancing can be
              useful with large farms or when servers are frequently added
              or removed as it may avoid the hammering effect that could
              result from roundrobin or leastconn in this situation. The
              hash-balance-factor directive can be used to further improve
              fairness of the load balancing, especially in situations
              where servers show highly variable response times. When an
              argument &lt;draws&gt; is present, it must be an integer value one
              or greater, indicating the number of draws before selecting
              the least loaded of these servers. It was indeed demonstrated
              that picking the least loaded of two servers is enough to
              significantly improve the fairness of the algorithm, by
              always avoiding to pick the most loaded server within a farm
              and getting rid of any bias that could be induced by the
              unfair distribution of the consistent list. Higher values N
              will take away N-1 of the highest loaded servers at the
              expense of performance. With very high values, the algorithm
              will converge towards the leastconn's result but much slower.
              The default value is 2, which generally shows very good
              distribution and performance. This algorithm is also known as
              the Power of Two Random Choices and is described here :
              http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf

  rdp-cookie
  rdp-cookie(&lt;name&gt;)
              The RDP cookie &lt;name&gt; (or "mstshash" if omitted) will be
              looked up and hashed for each incoming TCP request. Just as
              with the equivalent ACL 'req_rdp_cookie()' function, the name
              is not case-sensitive. This mechanism is useful as a degraded
              persistence mode, as it makes it possible to always send the
              same user (or the same session ID) to the same server. If the
              cookie is not found, the normal roundrobin algorithm is
              used instead.

              Note that for this to work, the frontend must ensure that an
              RDP cookie is already present in the request buffer. For this
              you must use 'tcp-request content accept' rule combined with
              a 'req_rdp_cookie_cnt' ACL.

              This algorithm is static by default, which means that
              changing a server's weight on the fly will have no effect,
              but this can be changed using "<a href="#hash-type">hash-type</a>".

              See also the rdp_cookie pattern fetch function.

&lt;arguments&gt; is an optional list of arguments which may be needed by some

<pre class="text">Note: the following caveats and limitations on using the "check_post"
extension with "<a href="#url_param">url_param</a>" must be considered :

  - all POST requests are eligible for consideration, because there is no way
    to determine if the parameters will be found in the body or entity which
    may contain binary data. Therefore another method may be required to
    restrict consideration of POST requests that have no URL parameters in
    the body. (see acl http_end)

  - using a &lt;max_wait&gt; value larger than the request buffer size does not
    make sense and is useless. The buffer size is set at build time, and
    defaults to 16 kB.

  - Content-Encoding is not supported, the parameter search will probably
    fail; and load balancing will fall back to Round Robin.

  - Expect: 100-continue is not supported, load balancing will fall back to
    Round Robin.

  - Transfer-Encoding (RFC7230 3.3.1) is only supported in the first chunk.
    If the entire parameter value is not present in the first chunk, the
    selection of server is undefined (actually, defined by how little
    actually appeared in the first chunk).

  - This feature does not support generation of a 100, 411 or 501 response.

  - In some cases, requesting "check_post" MAY attempt to scan the entire
    contents of a message body. Scanning normally terminates when linear
    white space or control characters are found, indicating the end of what
    might be a URL parameter list. This is probably not a concern with SGML
    type message bodies.

              address, or '*'. It designates the address the frontend will
              listen on. If unset, all IPv4 addresses of the system will be
              listened on. The same will apply for '*' or the system's
              special address "0.0.0.0". The IPv6 equivalent is '::'.
              Optionally, an address family prefix may be used before the
              address to force the family regardless of the address format,
              which can be useful to specify a path to a unix socket with
              no slash ('/'). Currently supported prefixes are :
                - 'ipv4@'  -&gt; address is always IPv4
                - 'ipv6@'  -&gt; address is always IPv6
                - 'udp@'   -&gt; address is resolved as IPv4 or IPv6 and
                  protocol UDP is used. Currently those listeners are
                  supported only in log-forward sections.
                - 'udp4@'  -&gt; address is always IPv4 and protocol UDP
                  is used. Currently those listeners are supported
                  only in log-forward sections.
                - 'udp6@'  -&gt; address is always IPv6 and protocol UDP
                  is used. Currently those listeners are supported
                  only in log-forward sections.
                - 'unix@'  -&gt; address is a path to a local unix socket
                - 'abns@'  -&gt; address is in abstract namespace (Linux only).
                  Note: since abstract sockets are not "rebindable", they
                        do not cope well with multi-process mode during
                        soft-restart, so it is better to avoid them if
                        nbproc is greater than 1. The effect is that if the
                        new process fails to start, only one of the old ones
                        will be able to rebind to the socket.
                - 'fd@&lt;n&gt;' -&gt; use file descriptor &lt;n&gt; inherited from the
                  parent. The fd must be bound and may or may not already
                  be listening.
                - 'sockpair@&lt;n&gt;'-&gt; like fd@ but you must use the fd of a
                  connected unix socket or of a socketpair. The bind waits
                  to receive a FD over the unix socket and uses it as if it
                  was the FD of an accept(). Should be used carefully.
              You may want to reference some environment variables in the
              address parameter, see <a href="#2.3">section 2.3</a> about environment
              variables.

&lt;port_range&gt;  is either a unique TCP port, or a port range for which the
              proxy will accept connections for the IP address specified
              above. The port is mandatory for TCP listeners. Note that in
              the case of an IPv6 address, the port is always the number
              after the last colon (':'). A range can either be :
               - a numerical port (ex: '80')
               - a dash-delimited ports range explicitly stating the lower
                 and upper bounds (ex: '2000-2100') which are included in
                 the range.

              Particular care must be taken against port ranges, because
              every &lt;address:port&gt; couple consumes one socket (= a file
              descriptor), so it's easy to consume lots of descriptors
              with a simple range, and to run out of sockets. Also, each
              &lt;address:port&gt; couple must be used only once among all
              instances running on a same system. Please note that binding
              to ports lower than 1024 generally require particular
              privileges to start the program, which are independent of
              the 'uid' parameter.

&lt;path&gt;        is a UNIX socket path beginning with a slash ('/'). This is
              alternative to the TCP listening port. HAProxy will then
              receive UNIX connections on the socket located at this place.
              The path must begin with a slash and by default is absolute.
              It can be relative to the prefix defined by "<a href="#unix-bind">unix-bind</a>" in
              the global section. Note that the total length of the prefix
              followed by the socket path cannot exceed some system limits
              for UNIX sockets, which commonly are set to 107 characters.

&lt;param*&gt;      is a list of parameters common to all sockets declared on the
              same line. These numerous parameters depend on OS and build

              higher bound can be omitted. In such case, it is replaced by
              the corresponding maximum value. If a proxy is bound to
              process numbers greater than the configured global.nbproc, it
              will either be forced to process #1 if a single process was
              specified, or to all processes otherwise.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">This keyword limits binding of certain instances to certain processes. This
is useful in order not to have too many processes listening to the same
ports. For instance, on a dual-core machine, it might make sense to set
'nbproc 2' in the global section, then distributes the listeners among 'odd'
and 'even' instances.

At the moment, it is not possible to reference more than 32 or 64 processes
using this keyword, but this should be more than enough for most setups.
Please note that 'all' really means all processes regardless of the machine's
word size, and is not limited to the first 32 or 64.

Each "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" line may further be limited to a subset of the proxy's processes,
please consult the "<a href="#process">process</a>" bind keyword in <a href="#5.1">section 5.1</a>.

When a frontend has no explicit "<a href="#bind-process">bind-process</a>" line, it tries to bind to all
the processes referenced by its "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" lines. That means that frontends can
easily adapt to their listeners' processes.

If some backends are referenced by frontends bound to other processes, the
backend automatically inherits the frontend's processes.

offload  makes HAProxy work as a compression offloader only (see notes).</pre> </div> <pre class="text">The currently supported algorithms are :
  identity     this is mostly for debugging, and it was useful for developing
               the compression feature. Identity does not apply any change on
               data.

  gzip         applies gzip compression. This setting is only available when
               support for zlib or libslz was built in.

  deflate      same as "gzip", but with deflate algorithm and zlib format.
               Note that this algorithm has ambiguous support on many
               browsers and no support at all from recent ones. It is
               strongly recommended not to use it for anything else than
               experimentation. This setting is only available when support
               for zlib or libslz was built in.

  raw-deflate  same as "deflate" without the zlib wrapper, and used as an
               alternative when the browser wants "deflate". All major
               browsers understand it and despite violating the standards,
               it is known to work better than "deflate", at least on MSIE
               and some versions of Safari. Do not use it in conjunction
               with "deflate", use either one or the other since both react
               to the same Accept-Encoding token. This setting is only
               available when support for zlib or libslz was built in.

Compression will be activated depending on the Accept-Encoding request
header. With identity, it does not take care of that header.
If backend servers support HTTP compression, these directives
will be no-op: HAProxy will see the compressed response and will not
compress again. If backend servers do not support HTTP compression and
there is Accept-Encoding header in request, HAProxy will compress the
matching response.

The "offload" setting makes HAProxy remove the Accept-Encoding header to
prevent backend servers from compressing responses. It is strongly
recommended not to do this because this means that all the compression work
will be done on the single point where HAProxy is located. However in some
deployment scenarios, HAProxy may be installed in front of a buggy gateway
with broken HTTP compression implementation which can't be turned off.
In that case HAProxy can be used to prevent that gateway from emitting
invalid payloads. In this case, simply removing the header in the
configuration does not work because it applies before the header is parsed,
so that prevents HAProxy from compressing. The "offload" setting should
then be used for such scenarios. Note: for now, the "offload" setting is
ignored when set in a defaults section.

Compression is disabled when:
  * the request does not advertise a supported compression algorithm in the
    "Accept-Encoding" header
  * the response message is not HTTP/1.1 or above
  * HTTP status code is not one of 200, 201, 202, or 203
  * response contain neither a "Content-Length" header nor a
    "Transfer-Encoding" whose last value is "chunked"
  * response contains a "Content-Type" header whose first value starts with
    "multipart"
  * the response contains the "no-transform" value in the "Cache-control"
    header
  * User-Agent matches "Mozilla/4" unless it is MSIE 6 with XP SP2, or MSIE 7
    and later
  * The response contains a "Content-Encoding" header, indicating that the
    response is already compressed (see compression offload)
  * The response contains an invalid "ETag" header or multiple ETag headers

Note: The compression does not emit the Warning header.

          inserted in order to bring persistence. This cookie is sent to
          the client via a "Set-Cookie" header in the response, and is
          brought back by the client in a "Cookie" header in all requests.
          Special care should be taken to choose a name which does not
          conflict with any likely application cookie. Also, if the same
          backends are subject to be used by the same clients (e.g.
          HTTP/HTTPS), care should be taken to use different cookie names
          between all backends if persistence between them is not desired.

rewrite   This keyword indicates that the cookie will be provided by the
          server and that HAProxy will have to modify its value to set the
          server's identifier in it. This mode is handy when the management
          of complex combinations of "Set-cookie" and "Cache-control"
          headers is left to the application. The application can then
          decide whether or not it is appropriate to emit a persistence
          cookie. Since all responses should be monitored, this mode
          doesn't work in HTTP tunnel mode. Unless the application
          behavior is very complex and/or broken, it is advised not to
          start with this mode for new deployments. This keyword is
          incompatible with "insert" and "prefix".

insert    This keyword indicates that the persistence cookie will have to
          be inserted by HAProxy in server responses if the client did not

          already have a cookie that would have permitted it to access this
          server. When used without the "preserve" option, if the server
          emits a cookie with the same name, it will be removed before
          processing. For this reason, this mode can be used to upgrade
          existing configurations running in the "rewrite" mode. The cookie
          will only be a session cookie and will not be stored on the
          client's disk. By default, unless the "indirect" option is added,
          the server will see the cookies emitted by the client. Due to
          caching effects, it is generally wise to add the "nocache" or
          "postonly" keywords (see below). The "insert" keyword is not
          compatible with "rewrite" and "prefix".

prefix    This keyword indicates that instead of relying on a dedicated
          cookie for the persistence, an existing one will be completed.
          This may be needed in some specific environments where the client
          does not support more than one single cookie and the application
          already needs it. In this case, whenever the server sets a cookie
          named &lt;name&gt;, it will be prefixed with the server's identifier
          and a delimiter. The prefix will be removed from all client
          requests so that the server still finds the cookie it emitted.
          Since all requests and responses are subject to being modified,
          this mode doesn't work with tunnel mode. The "prefix" keyword is
          not compatible with "rewrite" and "insert". Note: it is highly
          recommended not to use "indirect" with "prefix", otherwise server
          cookie updates would not be sent to clients.

indirect  When this option is specified, no cookie will be emitted to a
          client which already has a valid one for the server which has
          processed the request. If the server sets such a cookie itself,
          it will be removed, unless the "preserve" option is also set. In
          "insert" mode, this will additionally remove cookies from the
          requests transmitted to the server, making the persistence
          mechanism totally transparent from an application point of view.
          Note: it is highly recommended not to use "indirect" with
          "prefix", otherwise server cookie updates would not be sent to
          clients.

nocache   This option is recommended in conjunction with the insert mode
          when there is a cache between the client and HAProxy, as it
          ensures that a cacheable response will be tagged non-cacheable if
          a cookie needs to be inserted. This is important because if all
          persistence cookies are added on a cacheable home page for
          instance, then all customers will then fetch the page from an
          outer cache and will all share the same persistence cookie,
          leading to one server receiving much more traffic than others.
          See also the "insert" and "postonly" options.

postonly  This option ensures that cookie insertion will only be performed
          on responses to POST requests. It is an alternative to the
          "nocache" option, because POST responses are not cacheable, so
          this ensures that the persistence cookie will never get cached.
          Since most sites do not need any sort of persistence before the
          first POST which generally is a login request, this is a very
          efficient method to optimize caching without risking to find a
          persistence cookie in the cache.
          See also the "insert" and "nocache" options.

preserve  This option may only be used with "insert" and/or "indirect". It
          allows the server to emit the persistence cookie itself. In this
          case, if a cookie is found in the response, HAProxy will leave it
          untouched. This is useful in order to end persistence after a
          logout request for instance. For this, the server just has to
          emit a cookie with an invalid value (e.g. empty) or with a date in
          the past. By combining this mechanism with the "disable-on-404"
          check option, it is possible to perform a completely graceful
          shutdown because users will definitely leave the server after
          they logout.

httponly  This option tells HAProxy to add an "HttpOnly" cookie attribute
          when a cookie is inserted. This attribute is used so that a
          user agent doesn't share the cookie with non-HTTP components.
          Please check RFC6265 for more information on this attribute.

secure    This option tells HAProxy to add a "Secure" cookie attribute when
          a cookie is inserted. This attribute is used so that a user agent
          never emits this cookie over non-secure channels, which means
          that a cookie learned with this flag will be presented only over
          SSL/TLS connections. Please check RFC6265 for more information on
          this attribute.

domain    This option allows to specify the domain at which a cookie is
          inserted. It requires exactly one parameter: a valid domain
          name. If the domain begins with a dot, the browser is allowed to
          use it for any host ending with that name. It is also possible to
          specify several domain names by invoking this option multiple
          times. Some browsers might have small limits on the number of
          domains, so be careful when doing that. For the record, sending
          10 domains to MSIE 6 or Firefox 2 works as expected.

maxidle   This option allows inserted cookies to be ignored after some idle
          time. It only works with insert-mode cookies. When a cookie is
          sent to the client, the date this cookie was emitted is sent too.
          Upon further presentations of this cookie, if the date is older
          than the delay indicated by the parameter (in seconds), it will
          be ignored. Otherwise, it will be refreshed if needed when the
          response is sent to the client. This is particularly useful to
          prevent users who never close their browsers from remaining for
          too long on the same server (e.g. after a farm size change). When
          this option is set and a cookie has no date, it is always
          accepted, but gets refreshed in the response. This maintains the
          ability for admins to access their sites. Cookies that have a
          date in the future further than 24 hours are ignored. Doing so
          lets admins fix timezone issues without risking kicking users off
          the site.

maxlife   This option allows inserted cookies to be ignored after some life
          time, whether they're in use or not. It only works with insert
          mode cookies. When a cookie is first sent to the client, the date
          this cookie was emitted is sent too. Upon further presentations
          of this cookie, if the date is older than the delay indicated by
          the parameter (in seconds), it will be ignored. If the cookie in
          the request has no date, it is accepted and a date will be set.
          Cookies that have a date in the future further than 24 hours are
          ignored. Doing so lets admins fix timezone issues without risking
          kicking users off the site. Contrary to maxidle, this value is
          not refreshed, only the first visit date counts. Both maxidle and
          maxlife may be used at the time. This is particularly useful to
          prevent users who never close their browsers from remaining for
          too long on the same server (e.g. after a farm size change). This
          is stronger than the maxidle method in that it forces a
          redispatch after some absolute delay.

dynamic   Activate dynamic cookies. When used, a session cookie is
          dynamically created for each server, based on the IP and port
          of the server, and a secret key, specified in the
          "<a href="#dynamic-cookie-key">dynamic-cookie-key</a>" backend directive.
          The cookie will be regenerated each time the IP address change,
          and is only generated for IPv4/IPv6.

attr      This option tells HAProxy to add an extra attribute when a
          cookie is inserted. The attribute value can contain any
          characters except control ones or ";". This option may be
          repeated.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">There can be only one persistence cookie per HTTP backend, and it can be

&lt;file&gt;    designates a file containing the full HTTP response. It is
          recommended to follow the common practice of appending ".http" to
          the filename so that people do not confuse the response with HTML
          error pages, and to use absolute paths, since files are read
          before any chroot is performed.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">It is important to understand that this keyword is not meant to rewrite
errors returned by the server, but errors detected and returned by HAProxy.
This is why the list of supported errors is limited to a small set.

Code 200 is emitted in response to requests matching a "<a href="#monitor-uri">monitor-uri</a>" rule.

The files are parsed when HAProxy starts and must be valid according to the
HTTP specification. They should not exceed the configured buffer size
(BUFSIZE), which generally is 16 kB, otherwise an internal error will be
returned. It is also wise not to put any reference to local contents
(e.g. images) in order to avoid loops between the client and HAProxy when all
servers are down, causing an error to be returned instead of an
image. Finally, The response cannot exceed (tune.bufsize - tune.maxrewrite)
so that "<a href="#http-after-response">http-after-response</a>" rules still have room to operate (see
"<a href="#tune.maxrewrite">tune.maxrewrite</a>").

The files are read at the same time as the configuration and kept in memory.
For this reason, the errors continue to be returned even when the process is
chrooted, and no file change is considered while the process is running. A
simple method for developing those files consists in associating them to the
403 status code and interrogating a blocked URL.

force this using "<a href="#option%20persist">option persist</a>", but it is unconditional and redispatches
to a valid server if "<a href="#option%20redispatch">option redispatch</a>" is set. That leaves with very little
possibilities to force some requests to reach a server which is artificially
marked down for maintenance operations.

The "<a href="#force-persist">force-persist</a>" statement allows one to declare various ACL-based
conditions which, when met, will cause a request to ignore the down status of
a server and still try to connect to it. That makes it possible to start a
server, still replying an error to the health checks, and run a specially
configured browser to test the service. Among the handy methods, one could
use a specific source IP address, or a specific cookie. The cookie also has
the advantage that it can easily be added/removed on the browser from a test
page. Once the service is validated, it is then possible to open the service
to the world by returning a valid response to health checks.

The forced persistence is enabled when an "if" condition is met, or unless an
"unless" condition is met. The final redispatch is always disabled when this
is used.

makes it possible to limit the load on the servers during normal loads, but
push it further for important loads without overloading the servers during
exceptional loads.

10% of the sum of the maxconns of all frontends that may branch to this

&lt;factor&gt; is a percentage greater than 100. For example, if &lt;factor&gt; is 150,
then no server will be allowed to have a load more than 1.5 times the average.
If server weights are used, they will be respected.

If the first-choice server is disqualified, the algorithm will choose another
server based on the request hash, until a server with additional capacity is
found. A higher &lt;factor&gt; allows more imbalance between the servers, while a
lower &lt;factor&gt; means that more servers will be checked on average, affecting
performance. Reasonable values are from 125 to 200.

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span><pre class="prettyprint arguments">&lt;method&gt; is the method used to select a server from the hash computed by
         the &lt;function&gt; :

  map-based   the hash table is a static array containing all alive servers.
              The hashes will be very smooth, will consider weights, but
              will be static in that weight changes while a server is up
              will be ignored. This means that there will be no slow start.
              Also, since a server is selected by its position in the array,
              most mappings are changed when the server count changes. This
              means that when a server goes up or down, or when a server is
              added to a farm, most connections will be redistributed to
              different servers. This can be inconvenient with caches for
              instance.

  consistent  the hash table is a tree filled with many occurrences of each
              server. The hash key is looked up in the tree and the closest
              server is chosen. This hash is dynamic, it supports changing
              weights while the servers are up, so it is compatible with the
              slow start feature. It has the advantage that when a server
              goes up or down, only its associations are moved. When a
              server is added to the farm, only a few part of the mappings
              are redistributed, making it an ideal method for caches.
              However, due to its principle, the distribution will never be
              very smooth and it may sometimes be necessary to adjust a
              server's weight or its ID to get a more balanced distribution.
              In order to get the same distribution on multiple load
              balancers, it is important that all servers have the exact
              same IDs. Note: consistent hash uses sdbm and avalanche if no
              hash function is specified.

&lt;function&gt; is the hash function to be used :

   sdbm   this function was created initially for sdbm (a public-domain
          reimplementation of ndbm) database library. It was found to do
          well in scrambling bits, causing better distribution of the keys
          and fewer splits. It also happens to be a good general hashing
          function with good distribution, unless the total server weight
          is a multiple of 64, in which case applying the avalanche
          modifier may help.

   djb2   this function was first proposed by Dan Bernstein many years ago
          on comp.lang.c. Studies have shown that for certain workload this
          function provides a better distribution than sdbm. It generally
          works well with text-based inputs though it can perform extremely
          poorly with numeric-only input or when the total server weight is
          a multiple of 33, unless the avalanche modifier is also used.

   wt6    this function was designed for HAProxy while testing other
          functions in the past. It is not as smooth as the other ones, but
          is much less sensible to the input data set or to the number of
          servers. It can make sense as an alternative to sdbm+avalanche or
          djb2+avalanche for consistent hashing or when hashing on numeric
          data such as a source IP address or a visitor identifier in a URL
          parameter.

   crc32  this is the most common CRC32 implementation as used in Ethernet,
          gzip, PNG, etc. It is slower than the other ones but may provide
          a better distribution or less predictable results especially when
          used on strings.

&lt;modifier&gt; indicates an optional method applied after hashing the key :

   avalanche   This directive indicates that the result from the hash
               function above should not be used in its raw form but that
               a 4-byte full avalanche hash must be applied first. The
               purpose of this step is to mix the resulting bits from the
               previous hash in order to avoid any undesired effect when
               the input contains some limited values or when the number of
               servers is a multiple of one of the hash's components (64
               for SDBM, 33 for DJB2). Enabling avalanche tends to make the
               result less predictable, but it's also not as smooth as when
               using the original function. Some testing might be needed
               with some workloads. This hash is one of the many proposed
               by Bob Jenkins.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">The default hash type is "map-based" and is recommended for most usages. The

rewrites optional while others must be performed to continue the response

By default, the strict rewriting mode is enabled. Its value is also reset
when a ruleset evaluation ends. So, for instance, if you change the mode on

excluded from further load-balancing, but will still receive persistent
connections. This provides a very convenient method for Web administrators
to perform a graceful shutdown of their servers. It is also important to note
that a server which is detected as failed while it was in this mode will not
generate an alert, just a notice. If the server responds 2xx or 3xx again, it
will immediately be reinserted into the farm. The status on the stats page
reports "NOLB" for a server in this mode. It is important to note that this
option only works in conjunction with the "<a href="#option%20httpchk">httpchk</a>" option. If this option
is used with "<a href="#http-check%20expect">http-check expect</a>", then it has precedence over it so that 404
responses will still be considered as soft-stop. Note also that a stopped
server will stay stopped even if it replies 404s. This option is only
evaluated for running servers.

min-recv  is optional and can define the minimum amount of data required to

          option can be used to resolve some ambiguous matching rules or to

          the check will wait for more data. If set to 0, the evaluation
          result is always conclusive.

ok-status &lt;st&gt;     is optional and can be used to set the check status if

                   a timeout occurred during the expect rule evaluation.
                   "L7TOUT", "L6TOUT", and "L4TOUT" are supported :

                     - L4TOUT : layer 1-4 timeout
                   By default "L7TOUT" is used.

on-success &lt;fmt&gt;   is optional and can be used to customize the
                   informational message reported in logs if the expect
                   rule is successfully evaluated and if it is the last rule
                   in the tcp-check ruleset. &lt;fmt&gt; is a log-format string.

on-error &lt;fmt&gt;     is optional and can be used to customize the

                   occurred during the expect rule evaluation. &lt;fmt&gt; is a
                   log-format string.

&lt;match&gt;   is a keyword indicating how to look for a specific pattern in the
          response. The keyword may be one of "<a href="#status">status</a>", "rstatus", "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>",
          "fhdr", "string", or "rstring". The keyword may be preceded by an
          exclamation mark ("!") to negate the match. Spaces are allowed
          between the exclamation mark and the keyword. See below for more
          details on the supported keywords.

&lt;pattern&gt; is the pattern to look for. It may be a string, a regular
          expression or a more complex pattern with several arguments. If
          the string pattern contains spaces, they must be escaped with the
          usual backslash ('\').</pre> </div> <pre class="text">By default, "<a href="#option%20httpchk">option httpchk</a>" considers that response statuses 2xx and 3xx

it defines what is considered valid or invalid. Only one "<a href="#http-check">http-check</a>"
statement is supported in a backend. If a server fails to respond or times
out, the check obviously fails. The available matches are :

  status &lt;codes&gt; :  test the status codes found parsing &lt;codes&gt; string. it
                    must be a comma-separated list of status codes or range

                    valid if the response's status code matches any status
                    code or is inside any range of the list. If the "<a href="#status">status</a>"
                    keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response will be
                    considered invalid if the status code matches.

  rstatus &lt;regex&gt; : test a regular expression for the HTTP status code.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's status code matches the expression. If the
                    "rstatus" keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response
                    will be considered invalid if the status code matches.
                    This is mostly used to check for multiple codes.

                    method is used. If the "name-lf" parameter is used,
                    &lt;name&gt; is evaluated as a log-format string. If "value-lf"
                    parameter is used, &lt;value&gt; is evaluated as a log-format
                    string. These parameters cannot be used with the regex
                    matching method. Finally, the header value is considered
                    as comma-separated list. Note that matchings are case
                    insensitive on the header names.

  fhdr { name | name-lf } [ -m &lt;meth&gt; ] &lt;name&gt;
       [ { value | value-lf } [ -m &lt;meth&gt; ] &lt;value&gt; :
                    test the specified full header pattern on the HTTP
                    response headers. It does exactly the same than "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>"
                    keyword, except the full header value is tested, commas
                    are not considered as delimiters.

  string &lt;string&gt; : test the exact string match in the HTTP response body.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's body contains this exact string. If the
                    "string" keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response
                    will be considered invalid if the body contains this
                    string. This can be used to look for a mandatory word at
                    the end of a dynamic page, or to detect a failure when a
                    specific error appears on the check page (e.g. a stack
                    trace).

  rstring &lt;regex&gt; : test a regular expression on the HTTP response body.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's body matches this expression. If the "rstring"
                    keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response will be
                    considered invalid if the body matches the expression.
                    This can be used to look for a mandatory word at the end
                    of a dynamic page, or to detect a failure when a specific
                    error appears on the check page (e.g. a stack trace).

  string-lf &lt;fmt&gt; : test a log-format string match in the HTTP response body.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's body contains the  string resulting of the
                    evaluation of &lt;fmt&gt;, which follows the log-format rules.
                    If prefixed with "!", then the response will be
                    considered invalid if the body contains the string.

It is important to note that the responses will be limited to a certain size
defined by the global "<a href="#tune.bufsize">tune.bufsize</a>" option, which defaults to 16384 bytes.
Thus, too large responses may not contain the mandatory pattern when using
"string" or "rstring". If a large response is absolutely required, it is
possible to change the default max size by setting the global variable.
However, it is worth keeping in mind that parsing very large responses can
waste some CPU cycles, especially when regular expressions are used, and that
it is always better to focus the checks on smaller resources.

In an http-check ruleset, the last expect rule may be implicit. If no expect
rule is specified after the last "<a href="#http-check%20send">http-check send</a>", an implicit expect rule
is defined to match on 2xx or 3xx status codes. It means this rule is also
defined if there is no "<a href="#http-check">http-check</a>" rule at all, when only "<a href="#option%20httpchk">option httpchk</a>"
is set.

Last, if "<a href="#http-check%20expect">http-check expect</a>" is combined with "<a href="#http-check%20disable-on-404">http-check disable-on-404</a>",
then this last one has precedence when the server responds with 404.

meth &lt;method&gt;  is the optional HTTP method used with the requests. When not
               set, the "OPTIONS" method is used, as it generally requires
               low server processing and is easy to filter out from the
               logs. Any method may be used, though it is not recommended
               to invent non-standard ones.

uri &lt;uri&gt;      is optional and set the URI referenced in the HTTP requests
               to the string &lt;uri&gt;. It defaults to "/" which is accessible
               by default on almost any server, but may be changed to any
               other URI. Query strings are permitted.

uri-lf &lt;fmt&gt;   is optional and set the URI referenced in the HTTP requests
               using the log-format string &lt;fmt&gt;. It defaults to "/" which
               is accessible by default on almost any server, but may be
               changed to any other URI. Query strings are permitted.

ver &lt;version&gt;  is the optional HTTP version string. It defaults to
               "HTTP/1.0" but some servers might behave incorrectly in HTTP
               1.0, so turning it to HTTP/1.1 may sometimes help. Note that
               the Host field is mandatory in HTTP/1.1, use "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>" argument
               to add it.

hdr &lt;name&gt; &lt;fmt&gt;  adds the HTTP header field whose name is specified in
                  &lt;name&gt; and whose value is defined by &lt;fmt&gt;, which follows
                  to the log-format rules.

body &lt;string&gt;  add the body defined by &lt;string&gt; to the request sent during
               HTTP health checks. If defined, the "Content-Length" header
               is thus automatically added to the request.

body-lf &lt;fmt&gt;  add the body defined by the log-format string &lt;fmt&gt; to the
               request sent during HTTP health checks. If defined, the
               "Content-Length" header is thus automatically added to the
               request.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">In addition to the request line defined by the "<a href="#option%20httpchk">option httpchk</a>" directive,
this one is the valid way to add some headers and optionally a body to the
request sent during HTTP health checks. If a body is defined, the associate
"Content-Length" header is automatically added. Thus, this header or
"Transfer-encoding" header should not be present in the request provided by
"<a href="#http-check%20send">http-check send</a>". If so, it will be ignored. The old trick consisting to add
headers after the version string on the "<a href="#option%20httpchk">option httpchk</a>" line is now
deprecated.

Also "<a href="#http-check%20send">http-check send</a>" doesn't support HTTP keep-alive. Keep in mind that it
will automatically append a "Connection: close" header, unless a Connection
header has already already been configured via a hdr entry.

Note that the Host header and the request authority, when both defined, are
automatically synchronized. It means when the HTTP request is sent, when a
Host is inserted in the request, the request authority is accordingly
updated. Thus, don't be surprised if the Host header value overwrites the
configured request authority.

Note also for now, no Host header is automatically added in HTTP/1.1 or above
requests. You should add it explicitly.

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span> none </div> <pre class="text">When this option is set, HAProxy will systematically send a special header
"X-Haproxy-Server-State" with a list of parameters indicating to each server
how they are seen by HAProxy. This can be used for instance when a server is
manipulated without access to HAProxy and the operator needs to know whether
HAProxy still sees it up or not, or if the server is the last one in a farm.

The header is composed of fields delimited by semi-colons, the first of which
is a word ("UP", "DOWN", "NOLB"), possibly followed by a number of valid
checks on the total number before transition, just as appears in the stats
interface. Next headers are in the form "&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;value&gt;", indicating in
no specific order some values available in the stats interface :
  - a variable "address", containing the address of the backend server.
    This corresponds to the &lt;address&gt; field in the server declaration. For
    unix domain sockets, it will read "unix".

  - a variable "<a href="#port">port</a>", containing the port of the backend server. This
    corresponds to the &lt;port&gt; field in the server declaration. For unix
    domain sockets, it will read "unix".

  - a variable "<a href="#name">name</a>", containing the name of the backend followed by a slash
    ("/") then the name of the server. This can be used when a server is
    checked in multiple backends.

  - a variable "<a href="#node">node</a>" containing the name of the HAProxy node, as set in the
    global "<a href="#node">node</a>" variable, otherwise the system's hostname if unspecified.

  - a variable "<a href="#weight">weight</a>" indicating the weight of the server, a slash ("/")
    and the total weight of the farm (just counting usable servers). This
    helps to know if other servers are available to handle the load when this
    one fails.

  - a variable "scur" indicating the current number of concurrent connections
    on the server, followed by a slash ("/") then the total number of
    connections on all servers of the same backend.

  - a variable "qcur" indicating the current number of requests in the
    server's queue.

Example of a header received by the application server :
  &gt;&gt;&gt;  X-Haproxy-Server-State: UP 2/3; name=bck/srv2; node=lb1; weight=1/2; \
         scur=13/22; qcur=0

                     Currently, HAProxy is capable of generating codes
                     200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 407, 408, 410, 413, 425,
                     429, 500, 501, 502, 503, and 504.

content-type &lt;type&gt;  is the response content type, for instance
                     "text/plain". This parameter is ignored and should be
                     omitted when an errorfile is configured or when the
                     payload is empty. Otherwise, it must be defined.

default-errorfiles   Reset the previously defined error message for current
                     proxy for the status &lt;code&gt;. If used on a backend, the
                     frontend error message is used, if defined. If used on
                     a frontend, the default error message is used.

errorfile &lt;file&gt;     designates a file containing the full HTTP response.
                     It is recommended to follow the common practice of
                     appending ".http" to the filename so that people do
                     not confuse the response with HTML error pages, and to
                     use absolute paths, since files are read before any
                     chroot is performed.

errorfiles &lt;name&gt;    designates the http-errors section to use to import
                     the error message with the status code &lt;code&gt;. If no
                     such message is found, the proxy's error messages are
                     considered.

file &lt;file&gt;          specifies the file to use as response payload. If the
                     file is not empty, its content-type must be set as
                     argument to "content-type", otherwise, any
                     "content-type" argument is ignored. &lt;file&gt; is
                     considered as a raw string.

string &lt;str&gt;         specifies the raw string to use as response payload.
                     The content-type must always be set as argument to
                     "content-type".

lf-file &lt;file&gt;       specifies the file to use as response payload. If the
                     file is not empty, its content-type must be set as
                     argument to "content-type", otherwise, any
                     "content-type" argument is ignored. &lt;file&gt; is
                     evaluated as a log-format string.

lf-string &lt;str&gt;      specifies the log-format string to use as response
                     payload. The content-type must always be set as
                     argument to "content-type".

hdr &lt;name&gt; &lt;fmt&gt;     adds to the response the HTTP header field whose name
                     is specified in &lt;name&gt; and whose value is defined by
                     &lt;fmt&gt;, which follows to the log-format rules.
                     This parameter is ignored if an errorfile is used.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">This directive may be used instead of "<span class="dropdown">errorfile</span>", to define a custom error
message. As "<span class="dropdown">errorfile</span>" directive, it is used for errors detected and
returned by HAProxy. If an errorfile is defined, it is parsed when HAProxy
starts and must be valid according to the HTTP standards. The generated
response must not exceed the configured buffer size (BUFFSIZE), otherwise an
internal error will be returned.  Finally, if you consider to use some
http-after-response rules to rewrite these errors, the reserved buffer space
should be available (see "<a href="#tune.maxrewrite">tune.maxrewrite</a>").

The files are read at the same time as the configuration and kept in memory.
For this reason, the errors continue to be returned even when the process is
chrooted, and no file change is considered while the process is running.

Note: 400/408/500 errors emitted in early stage of the request parsing are
      handled by the multiplexer at a lower level. No custom formatting is
      supported at this level. Thus only static error messages, defined with
      "<span class="dropdown">errorfile</span>" directive, are supported. However, this limitation only
      exists during the request headers parsing or between two transactions.

</div> <pre class="text">The http-request statement defines a set of rules which apply to layer 7
processing. The rules are evaluated in their declaration order when they are
met in a frontend, listen or backend section. Any rule may optionally be
followed by an ACL-based condition, in which case it will only be evaluated
if the condition is true.

The first keyword is the rule's action. The supported actions are described

When using this action in a backend, double check that the relevant

ignored at run time. This can't be detected at configuration parsing time
due to HAProxy's ability to dynamically resolve backend name at runtime.

<pre class="text">Performs normalization of the request's URI.

URI normalization in HAProxy 2.4 is currently available as an experimental
technical preview. As such, it requires the global directive
'expose-experimental-directives' first to be able to invoke it. You should be
prepared that the behavior of normalizers might change to fix possible
issues, possibly breaking proper request processing in your infrastructure.

Each normalizer handles a single type of normalization to allow for a
fine-grained selection of the level of normalization that is appropriate for
the supported backend.

As an example the "path-strip-dotdot" normalizer might be useful for a static
fileserver that directly maps the requested URI to the path within the local
filesystem. However it might break routing of an API that expects a specific
number of segments in the path.

It is important to note that some normalizers might result in unsafe
transformations for broken URIs. It might also be possible that a combination
of normalizers that are safe by themselves results in unsafe transformations
when improperly combined.

As an example the "percent-decode-unreserved" normalizer might result in
unexpected results when a broken URI includes bare percent characters. One
such a broken URI is "/%%36%36" which would be decoded to "/%66" which in
turn is equivalent to "/f". By specifying the "strict" option requests to
such a broken URI would safely be rejected.

The following normalizers are available:

- fragment-encode: Encodes "#" as "%23".

    The "fragment-strip" normalizer should be preferred, unless it is known
    that broken clients do not correctly encode '#' within the path component.
</pre>
<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example:</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>- /#foo  -&gt; /%23foo
</code></pre> </div>
<pre class="text">- fragment-strip: Removes the URI's "fragment" component.

    According to RFC 3986#3.5 the "fragment" component of an URI should not
    be sent, but handled by the User Agent after retrieving a resource.

    This normalizer should be applied first to ensure that the fragment is
    not interpreted as part of the request's path component.

    their preceding segment.

    Empty segments do not receive special treatment. Use the "merge-slashes"

against.

It is worth noting that regular expressions may be more expensive to evaluate
than certain ACLs, so rare replacements may benefit from a condition to avoid
performing the evaluation at all if it does not match.

IMPORTANT NOTE: historically in HTTP/1.x, the vast majority of requests sent
by browsers use the "origin form", which differs from the "absolute form" in
that they do not contain a scheme nor authority in the URI portion. Mostly
only requests sent to proxies, those forged by hand and some emitted by
certain applications use the absolute form. As such, "replace-uri" usually
works fine most of the time in HTTP/1.x with rules starting with a "/". But
with HTTP/2, clients are encouraged to send absolute URIs only, which look
like the ones HTTP/1 clients use to talk to proxies. Such partial replace-uri
rules may then fail in HTTP/2 when they work in HTTP/1. Either the rules need
to be adapted to optionally match a scheme and authority, or replace-path
should be used.

<pre class="text">This stops the evaluation of the rules and immediately returns a response. The
default status code used for the response is 200. It can be optionally
specified as an arguments to "<a href="#status">status</a>". The response content-type may also be
specified as an argument to "content-type". Finally the response itself may
be defined. It can be a full HTTP response specifying the errorfile to use,
or the response payload specifying the file or the string to use. These rules
are followed to create the response :

* If neither the errorfile nor the payload to use is defined, a dummy
  response is returned. Only the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It can be
  any code in the range [200, 599]. The "content-type" argument, if any, is
  ignored.

* If "default-errorfiles" argument is set, the proxy's errorfiles are
  considered.  If the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is defined, it must be one of the
  status code handled by HAProxy (200, 400, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 413,
  425, 429, 500, 501, 502, 503, and 504). The "content-type" argument, if
  any, is ignored.

* If a specific errorfile is defined, with an "<span class="dropdown">errorfile</span>" argument, the
  corresponding file, containing a full HTTP response, is returned. Only the
  "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It must be one of the status code handled
  by HAProxy (200, 400, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 413, 425, 429, 500, 501,
  502, 503, and 504). The "content-type" argument, if any, is ignored.

* If an http-errors section is defined, with an "<a href="#errorfiles">errorfiles</a>" argument, the
  corresponding file in the specified http-errors section, containing a full
  HTTP response, is returned. Only the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It
  must be one of the status code handled by HAProxy (200, 400, 403, 404, 405,
  408, 410, 413, 425, 429, 500, 501, 502, 503, and 504). The "content-type"
  argument, if any, is ignored.

* If a "file" or a "lf-file" argument is specified, the file's content is
  used as the response payload. If the file is not empty, its content-type
  must be set as argument to "content-type". Otherwise, any "content-type"
  argument is ignored. With a "lf-file" argument, the file's content is
  evaluated as a log-format string. With a "file" argument, it is considered
  as a raw content.

* If a "string" or "lf-string" argument is specified, the defined string is
  used as the response payload. The content-type must always be set as
  argument to "content-type". With a "lf-string" argument, the string is
  evaluated as a log-format string. With a "string" argument, it is
  considered as a raw string.

When the response is not based on an errorfile, it is possible to append HTTP
header fields to the response using "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>" arguments. Otherwise, all "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>"
arguments are ignored. For each one, the header name is specified in &lt;name&gt;
and its value is defined by &lt;fmt&gt; which follows the log-format rules.

Note that the generated response must be smaller than a buffer. And to avoid
any warning, when an errorfile or a raw file is loaded, the buffer space
reserved for the headers rewriting should also be free.

No further "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" rules are evaluated.

When a request is queued, it is ordered first by the priority class, then by
the current timestamp adjusted by the given offset in milliseconds. Lower

Note that the resulting timestamp is is only tracked with enough precision
for 524,287ms (8m44s287ms). If the request is queued long enough to where the
adjusted timestamp exceeds this value, it will be misidentified as highest
priority. Thus it is important to set "<a href="#timeout%20queue">timeout queue</a>" to a value, where when
combined with the offset, does not exceed this limit.

<pre class="text">This stops the evaluation of the rules and makes the client-facing connection
suddenly disappear using a system-dependent way that tries to prevent the
client from being notified. The effect it then that the client still sees an
established connection while there's none on HAProxy. The purpose is to
achieve a comparable effect to "tarpit" except that it doesn't use any local
resource at all on the machine running HAProxy. It can resist much higher
loads than "tarpit", and slow down stronger attackers. It is important to
understand the impact of using this mechanism. All stateful equipment placed
between the client and HAProxy (firewalls, proxies, load balancers) will also
keep the established connection for a long time and may suffer from this
action.
On modern Linux systems running with enough privileges, the TCP_REPAIR socket
option is used to block the emission of a TCP reset. On other systems, the
socket's TTL is reduced to 1 so that the TCP reset doesn't pass the first
router, though it's still delivered to local networks. Do not use it unless
you fully understand how it works.

silently ignored. The purpose of the strict rewriting mode is to make some
rewrites optional while others must be performed to continue the request
processing.

By default, the strict rewriting mode is enabled. Its value is also reset
when a ruleset evaluation ends. So, for instance, if you change the mode on
the frontend, the default mode is restored when HAProxy starts the backend
rules evaluation.

is still connected, a response is returned so that the client does not
suspect it has been tarpitted. Logs will report the flags "PT". The goal of
the tarpit rule is to slow down robots during an attack when they're limited
on the number of concurrent requests. It can be very efficient against very
dumb robots, and will significantly reduce the load on firewalls compared to
a "deny" rule. But when facing "correctly" developed robots, it can make
things worse by forcing HAProxy and the front firewall to support insane
number of concurrent connections. By default an HTTP error 500 is returned.
But the response may be customized using same syntax than
"<a href="#http-request%20return">http-request return</a>" rules. Thus, see "<a href="#http-request%20return">http-request return</a>" for details.
For compatibility purpose, when no argument is defined, or only "deny_status",
the argument "default-errorfiles" is implied. It means
"http-request tarpit [deny_status &lt;status&gt;]" is an alias of

it is not found, an entry is allocated for it. Then a pointer to that entry
is kept during all the session's life, and this entry's counters are updated
as often as possible, every time the session's counters are updated, and also
systematically when the session ends. Counters are only updated for events
that happen after the tracking has been started. As an exception, connection
counters and request counters are systematically updated so that they reflect
useful information.

If the entry tracks concurrent connection counters, one connection is counted
for as long as the entry is tracked, and the entry will not expire during
that time. Tracking counters also provides a performance advantage over just
checking the keys, because only one table lookup is performed for all ACL
checks that make use of it.

The keyword "<span class="dropdown">id</span>" is the id of the capture slot which is used for storing the

When using this action in a backend, double check that the relevant

default status code used for the response is 200. It can be optionally
specified as an arguments to "<a href="#status">status</a>". The response content-type may also be
specified as an argument to "content-type". Finally the response itself may
be defined. If can be a full HTTP response specifying the errorfile to use,
or the response payload specifying the file or the string to use. These rules
are followed to create the response :

* If neither the errorfile nor the payload to use is defined, a dummy
  response is returned. Only the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It can be
  any code in the range [200, 599]. The "content-type" argument, if any, is
  ignored.

* If "default-errorfiles" argument is set, the proxy's errorfiles are
  considered.  If the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is defined, it must be one of the
  status code handled by HAProxy (200, 400, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 413,
  425, 429, 500, 501, 502, 503, and 504). The "content-type" argument, if
  any, is ignored.

* If a specific errorfile is defined, with an "<span class="dropdown">errorfile</span>" argument, the
  corresponding file, containing a full HTTP response, is returned. Only the
  "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It must be one of the status code handled

  502, 503, and 504). The "content-type" argument, if any, is ignored.

* If an http-errors section is defined, with an "<a href="#errorfiles">errorfiles</a>" argument, the
  corresponding file in the specified http-errors section, containing a full
  HTTP response, is returned. Only the "<a href="#status">status</a>" argument is considered. It
  must be one of the status code handled by HAProxy (200, 400, 403, 404, 405,
  408, 410, 413, 425, 429, 500, 501, 502, 503, and 504). The "content-type"
  argument, if any, is ignored.

* If a "file" or a "lf-file" argument is specified, the file's content is
  used as the response payload. If the file is not empty, its content-type
  must be set as argument to "content-type". Otherwise, any "content-type"
  argument is ignored. With a "lf-file" argument, the file's content is
  evaluated as a log-format string. With a "file" argument, it is considered
  as a raw content.

* If a "string" or "lf-string" argument is specified, the defined string is
  used as the response payload. The content-type must always be set as
  argument to "content-type". With a "lf-string" argument, the string is
  evaluated as a log-format string. With a "string" argument, it is
  considered as a raw string.

When the response is not based an errorfile, it is possible to appends HTTP
header fields to the response using "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>" arguments. Otherwise, all "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>"
arguments are ignored. For each one, the header name is specified in &lt;name&gt;
and its value is defined by &lt;fmt&gt; which follows the log-format rules.

Note that the generated response must be smaller than a buffer. And to avoid
any warning, when an errorfile or a raw file is loaded, the buffer space
reserved to the headers rewriting should also be free.

No further "<span class="dropdown">http-response</span>" rules are evaluated.

<pre class="text">This stops the evaluation of the rules and makes the client-facing connection
suddenly disappear using a system-dependent way that tries to prevent the
client from being notified. The effect it then that the client still sees an
established connection while there's none on HAProxy. The purpose is to
achieve a comparable effect to "tarpit" except that it doesn't use any local
resource at all on the machine running HAProxy. It can resist much higher
loads than "tarpit", and slow down stronger attackers. It is important to
understand the impact of using this mechanism. All stateful equipment placed
between the client and HAProxy (firewalls, proxies, load balancers) will also
keep the established connection for a long time and may suffer from this
action.
On modern Linux systems running with enough privileges, the TCP_REPAIR socket
option is used to block the emission of a TCP reset. On other systems, the
socket's TTL is reduced to 1 so that the TCP reset doesn't pass the first
router, though it's still delivered to local networks. Do not use it unless
you fully understand how it works.

<pre class="text">This enables or disables the strict rewriting mode for following rules. It
does not affect rules declared before it and it is only applicable on rules
performing a rewrite on the responses. When the strict mode is enabled, any
rewrite failure triggers an internal error. Otherwise, such errors are
silently ignored. The purpose of the strict rewriting mode is to make some
rewrites optional while others must be performed to continue the response
processing.

By default, the strict rewriting mode is enabled. Its value is also reset
when a ruleset evaluation ends. So, for instance, if you change the mode on
the backend, the default mode is restored when HAProxy starts the frontend
rules evaluation.

</div> <pre class="text">By default, a connection established between HAProxy and the backend server
which is considered safe for reuse is moved back to the server's idle
connections pool so that any other request can make use of it. This is the
"safe" strategy below.

The argument indicates the desired connection reuse strategy :

  - "never"  : idle connections are never shared between sessions. This mode
               may be enforced to cancel a different strategy inherited from
               a defaults section or for troubleshooting. For example, if an
               old bogus application considers that multiple requests over
               the same connection come from the same client and it is not
               possible to fix the application, it may be desirable to
               disable connection sharing in a single backend. An example of
               such an application could be an old HAProxy using cookie
               insertion in tunnel mode and not checking any request past the
               first one.

  - "safe"   : this is the default and the recommended strategy. The first
               request of a session is always sent over its own connection,
               and only subsequent requests may be dispatched over other
               existing connections. This ensures that in case the server
               closes the connection when the request is being sent, the
               browser can decide to silently retry it. Since it is exactly
               equivalent to regular keep-alive, there should be no side
               effects. There is also a special handling for the connections
               using protocols subject to Head-of-line blocking (backend with
               h2 or fcgi). In this case, when at least one stream is
               processed, the used connection is reserved to handle streams
               of the same session. When no more streams are processed, the
               connection is released and can be reused.

  - "aggressive" : this mode may be useful in webservices environments where
               all servers are not necessarily known and where it would be
               appreciable to deliver most first requests over existing
               connections. In this case, first requests are only delivered
               over existing connections that have been reused at least once,
               proving that the server correctly supports connection reuse.
               It should only be used when it's sure that the client can
               retry a failed request once in a while and where the benefit
               of aggressive connection reuse significantly outweighs the
               downsides of rare connection failures.

  - "always" : this mode is only recommended when the path to the server is
               known for never breaking existing connections quickly after
               releasing them. It allows the first request of a session to be
               sent to an existing connection. This can provide a significant
               performance increase over the "safe" strategy when the backend
               is a cache farm, since such components tend to show a
               consistent behavior and will benefit from the connection
               sharing. It is recommended that the "<a href="#option%20http-keep-alive">http-keep-alive</a>" timeout
               remains low in this mode so that no dead connections remain
               usable. In most cases, this will lead to the same performance
               gains as "aggressive" but with more risks. It should only be
               used when it improves the situation over "aggressive".

When http connection sharing is enabled, a great care is taken to respect the
connection properties and compatibility. Indeed, some properties are specific
and it is not possibly to reuse it blindly. Those are the SSL SNI, source
and destination address and proxy protocol block. A connection is reused only
if it shares the same set of properties with the request.

Also note that connections with certain bogus authentication schemes (relying
on the connection) like NTLM are marked private and never shared.

A connection pool is involved and configurable with "<a href="#pool-max-conn">pool-max-conn</a>".

Note: connection reuse improves the accuracy of the "server maxconn" setting,
because almost no new connection will be established while idle connections
remain available. This is particularly true with the "always" strategy.

to be set to the name of the target server at the moment the request is about

Upon retries and redispatches, the header field is updated to always reflect
the server being attempted to connect to. Given that this header is modified
very late in the connection setup, it may have unexpected effects on already
modified headers. For example using it with transport-level header such as
connection, content-length, transfer-encoding and so on will likely result in
invalid requests being sent to the server. Additionally it has been reported
that this directive is currently being used as a way to overwrite the Host
header field in outgoing requests; while this trick has been known to work
as a side effect of the feature for some time, it is not officially supported
and might possibly not work anymore in a future version depending on the
technical difficulties this feature induces. A long-term solution instead
consists in fixing the application which required this trick so that it binds
to the correct host name.

           replaces &lt;address&gt;, &lt;facility&gt; and &lt;level&gt; with those of the log
           entries found in the "global" section. Only one "<span class="dropdown">log global</span>"
           statement may be used per instance, and this form takes no other
           parameter.

&lt;address&gt;  indicates where to send the logs. It takes the same format as
           for the "global" section's logs, and can be one of :

           - An IPv4 address optionally followed by a colon (':') and a UDP
             port. If no port is specified, 514 is used by default (the
             standard syslog port).

           - An IPv6 address followed by a colon (':') and optionally a UDP
             port. If no port is specified, 514 is used by default (the
             standard syslog port).

           - A filesystem path to a UNIX domain socket, keeping in mind
             considerations for chroot (be sure the path is accessible
             inside the chroot) and uid/gid (be sure the path is
             appropriately writable).

           - A file descriptor number in the form "fd@&lt;number&gt;", which may
             point to a pipe, terminal, or socket. In this case unbuffered
             logs are used and one writev() call per log is performed. This
             is a bit expensive but acceptable for most workloads. Messages
             sent this way will not be truncated but may be dropped, in
             which case the DroppedLogs counter will be incremented. The
             writev() call is atomic even on pipes for messages up to
             PIPE_BUF size, which POSIX recommends to be at least 512 and
             which is 4096 bytes on most modern operating systems. Any
             larger message may be interleaved with messages from other
             processes.  Exceptionally for debugging purposes the file
             descriptor may also be directed to a file, but doing so will
             significantly slow HAProxy down as non-blocking calls will be
             ignored. Also there will be no way to purge nor rotate this
             file without restarting the process. Note that the configured
             syslog format is preserved, so the output is suitable for use
             with a TCP syslog server. See also the "short" and "raw"
             formats below.

           - "stdout" / "stderr", which are respectively aliases for "fd@1"
             and "fd@2", see above.

           - A ring buffer in the form "ring@&lt;name&gt;", which will correspond
             to an in-memory ring buffer accessible over the CLI using the
             "show events" command, which will also list existing rings and
             their sizes. Such buffers are lost on reload or restart but
             when used as a complement this can help troubleshooting by
             having the logs instantly available.

           - An explicit stream address prefix such as "tcp@","tcp6@",
             "tcp4@" or "uxst@" will allocate an implicit ring buffer with
             a stream forward server targeting the given address.

           You may want to reference some environment variables in the
           address parameter, see <a href="#2.3">section 2.3</a> about environment variables.

&lt;length&gt;   is an optional maximum line length. Log lines larger than this
           value will be truncated before being sent. The reason is that
           syslog servers act differently on log line length. All servers
           support the default value of 1024, but some servers simply drop
           larger lines while others do log them. If a server supports long
           lines, it may make sense to set this value here in order to avoid
           truncating long lines. Similarly, if a server drops long lines,
           it is preferable to truncate them before sending them. Accepted
           values are 80 to 65535 inclusive. The default value of 1024 is
           generally fine for all standard usages. Some specific cases of
           long captures or JSON-formatted logs may require larger values.

&lt;ranges&gt;   A list of comma-separated ranges to identify the logs to sample.
           This is used to balance the load of the logs to send to the log
           server. The limits of the ranges cannot be null. They are numbered
           from 1. The size or period (in number of logs) of the sample must
           be set with &lt;sample_size&gt; parameter.

&lt;sample_size&gt;
           The size of the sample in number of logs to consider when balancing
           their logging loads. It is used to balance the load of the logs to
           send to the syslog server. This size must be greater or equal to the
           maximum of the high limits of the ranges.
           (see also &lt;ranges&gt; parameter).

&lt;format&gt; is the log format used when generating syslog messages. It may be
         one of the following :

  local     Analog to rfc3164 syslog message format except that hostname
            field is stripped. This is the default.
            Note: option "<a href="#log-send-hostname">log-send-hostname</a>" switches the default to
            rfc3164.

  rfc3164   The RFC3164 syslog message format.
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164)

  rfc5424   The RFC5424 syslog message format.
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424)

  priority  A message containing only a level plus syslog facility between
            angle brackets such as '&lt;63&gt;', followed by the text. The PID,
            date, time, process name and system name are omitted. This is
            designed to be used with a local log server.

  short     A message containing only a level between angle brackets such as
            '&lt;3&gt;', followed by the text. The PID, date, time, process name
            and system name are omitted. This is designed to be used with a
            local log server. This format is compatible with what the
            systemd logger consumes.

  timed     A message containing only a level between angle brackets such as
            '&lt;3&gt;', followed by ISO date and by the text. The PID, process
            name and system name are omitted. This is designed to be
            used with a local log server.

  iso       A message containing only the ISO date, followed by the text.
            The PID, process name and system name are omitted. This is
            designed to be used with a local log server.

  raw       A message containing only the text. The level, PID, date, time,
            process name and system name are omitted. This is designed to
            be used in containers or during development, where the severity
            only depends on the file descriptor used (stdout/stderr).

&lt;facility&gt; must be one of the 24 standard syslog facilities :

               kern   user   mail   daemon auth   syslog lpr    news
               uucp   cron   auth2  ftp    ntp    audit  alert  cron2
               local0 local1 local2 local3 local4 local5 local6 local7

           Note that the facility is ignored for the "short" and "raw"
           formats, but still required as a positional field. It is
           recommended to use "<a href="#daemon">daemon</a>" in this case to make it clear that
           it's only supposed to be used locally.

&lt;level&gt;    is optional and can be specified to filter outgoing messages. By
           default, all messages are sent. If a level is specified, only
           messages with a severity at least as important as this level
           will be sent. An optional minimum level can be specified. If it
           is set, logs emitted with a more severe level than this one will
           be capped to this level. This is used to avoid sending "emerg"
           messages on all terminals on some default syslog configurations.
           Eight levels are known :

             emerg  alert  crit   err    warning notice info  debug</pre> </div> <pre class="text">It is important to keep in mind that it is the frontend which decides what to
log from a connection, and that in case of content switching, the log entries
from the backend will be ignored. Connections are logged at level "info".

However, backend log declaration define how and where servers status changes
will be logged. Level "notice" will be used to indicate a server going up,
"warning" will be used for termination signals and definitive service
termination, and "alert" will be used for when a server goes down.

Note : According to RFC3164, messages are truncated to 1024 bytes before
       being emitted.

but sometimes it can be counter-productive, for example if a server has a lot
of connections while other ones are idle. This is especially true for static
servers.

The purpose of this setting is to set a threshold on the number of queued
connections at which HAProxy stops trying to reuse the same server and prefers
to find another one. The default value, -1, means there is no limit. A value
of zero means that keep-alive requests will never be queued. For very close
servers which can be reached with a low latency and which are not sensible to
breaking keep-alive, a low value is recommended (e.g. local static server can
use a value of 10 or less). For remote servers suffering from a high latency,
higher values might be needed to cover for the latency and/or the cost of
picking a different server.

Note that this has no impact on responses which are maintained to the same
server consecutively to a 401 response. They will still go to the same server
even if they have to be queued.

of tune.bufsize (16kB by default) each, as well as some other data resulting
in about 33 kB of RAM being consumed per established connection. That means
that a medium system equipped with 1GB of RAM can withstand around
20000-25000 concurrent connections if properly tuned.

Also, when &lt;conns&gt; is set to large values, it is possible that the servers
are not sized to accept such loads, and for this reason it is generally wise
to assign them some reasonable connection limits.

conditions defined with "<a href="#monitor%20fail">monitor fail</a>". This is normally enough for any
front-end HTTP probe to detect that the service is UP and running without
forwarding the request to a backend server. Note that the HTTP method, the
version and all headers are ignored, but the request must at least be valid
at the HTTP level. This keyword may only be used with an HTTP-mode frontend.

Monitor requests are processed very early, just after the request is parsed
and even before any "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>". The only rulesets applied before are the
tcp-request ones. They cannot be logged either, and it is the intended
purpose. They are only used to report HAProxy's health to an upper component,
nothing more. However, it is possible to add any number of conditions using
"<a href="#monitor%20fail">monitor fail</a>" and ACLs so that the result can be adjusted to whatever check
can be imagined (most often the number of available servers in a backend).

Note: if &lt;uri&gt; starts by a slash ('/'), the matching is performed against the

      the HTTP/2 requests match the monitor-uri. Indeed, in HTTP/2, clients

The per-instance connection queue will inflate, and the response time will
increase respective to the size of the queue times the average per-session
response time. When clients will wait for more than a few seconds, they will
often hit the "STOP" button on their browser, leaving a useless request in
the queue, and slowing down other users, and the servers as well, because the
request will eventually be served, then aborted at the first error
encountered while delivering the response.

As there is no way to distinguish between a full STOP and a simple output
close on the client side, HTTP agents should be conservative and consider
that the client might only have closed its output channel while waiting for
the response. However, this introduces risks of congestion when lots of users
do the same, and is completely useless nowadays because probably no client at
all will close the session while waiting for the response. Some HTTP agents
support this behavior (Squid, Apache, HAProxy), and others do not (TUX, most
hardware-based load balancers). So the probability for a closed input channel
to represent a user hitting the "STOP" button is close to 100%, and the risk
of being the single component to break rare but valid traffic is extremely
low, which adds to the temptation to be able to abort a session early while
still not served and not pollute the servers.

In HAProxy, the user can choose the desired behavior using the option
"<a href="#option%20abortonclose">abortonclose</a>". By default (without the option) the behavior is HTTP
compliant and aborted requests will be served. But when the option is
specified, a session with an incoming channel closed will be aborted while
it is still possible, either pending in the queue for a connection slot, or
during the connection establishment if the server has not yet acknowledged
the connection request. This considerably reduces the queue size and the load
on saturated servers when users are tempted to click on STOP, which in turn
reduces the response time for other users.

If this option has been enabled in a "defaults" section, it can be disabled
in a specific instance by prepending the "no" keyword before it.

weaknesses, and bypass security filtering. Sometimes, a buggy browser or

('`'), 123 ('{'), 124 ('|'), 125 ('}'), 127 (delete) and anything above are
not allowed at all. HAProxy always blocks a number of them (0..32, 127). The
remaining ones are blocked by default unless this option is enabled. This
option also relaxes the test on the HTTP version, it allows HTTP/0.9 requests
to pass through (no version specified) and multiple digits for both the major
and the minor version.

This option should never be enabled by default as it hides application bugs
and open security breaches. It should only be deployed after a problem has
been confirmed.

When this option is enabled, erroneous header names will still be accepted in
requests, but the complete request will be captured in order to permit later
analysis using the "show errors" request on the UNIX stats socket. Similarly,
requests containing invalid chars in the URI part will be logged. Doing this
also helps confirming that the issue has been solved.

If this option has been enabled in a "defaults" section, it can be disabled
in a specific instance by prepending the "no" keyword before it.

always let enough control to the developer to manage how the responses should
be cached. When a session cookie is returned on a cacheable object, there is a
high risk of session crossing or stealing between users traversing the same
caches. In some situations, it is better to block the response than to let
some sensitive session information go in the wild.

The option "<a href="#option%20checkcache">checkcache</a>" enables deep inspection of all server responses for
strict compliance with HTTP specification in terms of cacheability. It
carefully checks "Cache-control", "Pragma" and "Set-cookie" headers in server
response to check if there's a risk of caching a cookie on a client-side
proxy. When this option is enabled, the only responses which can be delivered
to the client are :
  - all those without "Set-Cookie" header;
  - all those with a return code other than 200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301,
    404, 405, 410, 414, 501, provided that the server has not set a
    "Cache-control: public" header field;
  - all those that result from a request using a method other than GET, HEAD,
    OPTIONS, TRACE, provided that the server has not set a 'Cache-Control:
    public' header field;
  - those with a 'Pragma: no-cache' header
  - those with a 'Cache-control: private' header
  - those with a 'Cache-control: no-store' header
  - those with a 'Cache-control: max-age=0' header

  - those with a 'Cache-control: no-cache="<a href="#set-cookie">set-cookie</a>"' header
  - those with a 'Cache-control: no-cache="set-cookie,' header
    (allowing other fields after set-cookie)

If a response doesn't respect these requirements, then it will be blocked
just as if it was from an "<a href="#http-response%20deny">http-response deny</a>" rule, with an "HTTP 502 bad
gateway". The session state shows "PH--" meaning that the proxy blocked the
response during headers processing. Additionally, an alert will be sent in
the logs so that admins are informed that there's something to be fixed.

Due to the high impact on the application, the application should be tested
in depth with the option enabled before going to production. It is also a
good practice to always activate it during tests, even if it is not used in
production, as it will report potentially dangerous application behaviors.

a server, and when the protocol involves very long sessions with long idle
periods (e.g. remote desktops), there is a risk that one of the intermediate
components decides to expire a session which has remained idle for too long.

Enabling socket-level TCP keep-alives makes the system regularly send packets
to the other end of the connection, leaving it active. The delay between
keep-alive probes is controlled by the system only and depends both on the
operating system and its tuning parameters.

It is important to understand that keep-alive packets are neither emitted nor
received at the application level. It is only the network stacks which sees
them. For this reason, even if one side of the proxy already uses keep-alives
to maintain its connection alive, those keep-alive packets will not be
forwarded to the other side of the proxy.

Please note that this has nothing to do with HTTP keep-alive.

Using option "<a href="#option%20clitcpka">clitcpka</a>" enables the emission of TCP keep-alive probes on the
client side of a connection, which should help when session expirations are
noticed between HAProxy and a client.

their client address. This is sometimes annoying when the client's IP address
is expected in server logs. To solve this problem, the well-known HTTP header
"X-Forwarded-For" may be added by HAProxy to all requests sent to the server.
This header contains a value representing the client's IP address. Since this
header is always appended at the end of the existing header list, the server
must be configured to always use the last occurrence of this header only. See
the server's manual to find how to enable use of this standard header. Note
that only the last occurrence of the header must be used, since it is really
possible that the client has already brought one.

The keyword "header" may be used to supply a different header name to replace
the default "X-Forwarded-For". This can be useful where you might already
have a "X-Forwarded-For" header from a different application (e.g. stunnel),
and you need preserve it. Also if your backend server doesn't use the
"X-Forwarded-For" header and requires different one (e.g. Zeus Web Servers
require "X-Cluster-Client-IP").

Sometimes, a same HAProxy instance may be shared between a direct client
access and a reverse-proxy access (for instance when an SSL reverse-proxy is
used to decrypt HTTPS traffic). It is possible to disable the addition of the
header for a known source address or network by adding the "except" keyword
followed by the network address. In this case, any source IP matching the
network will not cause an addition of this header. Most common uses are with
private networks or 127.0.0.1. IPv4 and IPv6 are both supported.

Alternatively, the keyword "if-none" states that the header will only be
added if it is not present. This should only be used in perfectly trusted
environment, as this might cause a security issue if headers reaching HAProxy
are under the control of the end-user.

This option may be specified either in the frontend or in the backend. If at
least one of them uses it, the header will be added. Note that the backend's
setting of the header subargument takes precedence over the frontend's if
both are defined. In the case of the "if-none" argument, if at least one of
the frontend or the backend does not specify it, it wants the addition to be
mandatory, so it wins.

decides to close them first. These ones pollute the log and feed the error
counters. There was already "<a href="#option%20dontlognull">option dontlognull</a>" but it's insufficient in
this case. Instead, this option does the following things :
   - prevent any 400/408 message from being sent to the client if nothing
     was received over a connection before it was closed;
   - prevent any log from being emitted in this situation;
   - prevent any error counter from being incremented

That way the empty connection is silently ignored. Note that it is better
not to use this unless it is clear that it is needed, because it will hide
real problems. The most common reason for not receiving a request and seeing
a 408 is due to an MTU inconsistency between the client and an intermediary
element such as a VPN, which blocks too large packets. These issues are
generally seen with POST requests as well as GET with large cookies. The logs
are often the only way to detect them.

If this option has been enabled in a "defaults" section, it can be disabled
in a specific instance by prepending the "no" keyword before it.

connections: for each connection it processes each request and response, and
leaves the connection idle on both sides between the end of a response and
the start of a new request. This mode may be changed by several options such
as "<a href="#option%20http-server-close">option http-server-close</a>" or "<a href="#option%20httpclose">option httpclose</a>". This option allows to
set back the keep-alive mode, which can be useful when another mode was used
in a defaults section.

Setting "<a href="#option%20http-keep-alive">option http-keep-alive</a>" enables HTTP keep-alive mode on the client-
and server- sides. This provides the lowest latency on the client side (slow
network) and the fastest session reuse on the server side at the expense
of maintaining idle connections to the servers. In general, it is possible
with this option to achieve approximately twice the request rate that the
"<a href="#option%20http-server-close">http-server-close</a>" option achieves on small objects. There are mainly two
situations where this option may be useful :

  - when the server is non-HTTP compliant and authenticates the connection
    instead of requests (e.g. NTLM authentication)

  - when the cost of establishing the connection to the server is significant
    compared to the cost of retrieving the associated object from the server.

This last case can happen when the server is a fast static server of cache.
In this case, the server will need to be properly tuned to support high enough
connection counts because connections will last until the client sends another
request.

If the client request has to go to another backend or another server due to
content switching or the load balancing algorithm, the idle connection will
immediately be closed and a new one re-opened. Option "<a href="#option%20prefer-last-server">prefer-last-server</a>" is
available to try optimize server selection so that if the server currently
attached to an idle connection is usable, it will be used.

At the moment, logs will not indicate whether requests came from the same
session or not. The accept date reported in the logs corresponds to the end
of the previous request, and the request time corresponds to the time spent
waiting for a new request. The keep-alive request time is still bound to the
timeout defined by "<a href="#timeout%20http-keep-alive">timeout http-keep-alive</a>" or "<a href="#timeout%20http-request">timeout http-request</a>" if
not set.

This option disables and replaces any previous "<a href="#option%20httpclose">option httpclose</a>" or "option
http-server-close". When backend and frontend options differ, all of these 4
options have precedence over "<a href="#option%20http-keep-alive">option http-keep-alive</a>".

Any agent is expected to queue data somewhat for a reasonably low delay.
There are some very rare server-to-server applications that abuse the HTTP
protocol and expect the payload phase to be highly interactive, with many
interleaved data chunks in both directions within a single request. This is
absolutely not supported by the HTTP specification and will not work across
most proxies or servers. When such applications attempt to do this through
HAProxy, it works but they will experience high delays due to the network
optimizations which favor performance by instructing the system to wait for
enough data to be available in order to only send full packets. Typical
delays are around 200 ms per round trip. Note that this only happens with
abnormal uses. Normal uses such as CONNECT requests nor WebSockets are not
affected.

When "<a href="#option%20http-no-delay">option http-no-delay</a>" is present in either the frontend or the backend
used by a connection, all such optimizations will be disabled in order to
make the exchanges as fast as possible. Of course this offers no guarantee on
the functionality, as it may break at any other place. But if it works via
HAProxy, it will work as fast as possible. This option should never be used
by default, and should never be used at all unless such a buggy application
is discovered. The impact of using this option is an increase of bandwidth
usage and CPU usage, which may significantly lower performance in high
latency environments.

adds a "Connection: close" header to the request forwarded to the server.
Unfortunately, when some servers see this header, they automatically refrain
from using the chunked encoding for responses of unknown length, while this
is totally unrelated. The immediate effect is that this prevents HAProxy from
maintaining the client connection alive. A second effect is that a client or
a cache could receive an incomplete response without being aware of it, and
consider the response complete.

By setting "<a href="#option%20http-pretend-keepalive">option http-pretend-keepalive</a>", HAProxy will make the server
believe it will keep the connection alive. The server will then not fall back
to the abnormal undesired above. When HAProxy gets the whole response, it
will close the connection with the server just as it would do with the
"<a href="#option%20httpclose">option httpclose</a>". That way the client gets a normal response and the
connection is correctly closed on the server side.

It is recommended not to enable this option by default, because most servers
will more efficiently close the connection themselves after the last packet,
and release its buffers slightly earlier. Also, the added packet on the
network could slightly reduce the overall peak performance. However it is
worth noting that when this option is enabled, HAProxy will have slightly
less work to do. So if HAProxy is the bottleneck on the whole architecture,
enabling this option might save a few CPU cycles.

This option may be set in backend and listen sections. Using it in a frontend
section will be ignored and a warning will be reported during startup. It is
a backend related option, so there is no real reason to set it on a
frontend. This option may be combined with "<a href="#option%20httpclose">option httpclose</a>", which will
cause keepalive to be announced to the server and close to be announced to
the client. This practice is discouraged though.

If this option has been enabled in a "defaults" section, it can be disabled
in a specific instance by prepending the "no" keyword before it.

Connection header to indicate their wish of persistent or non-persistent
connections, both browsers and proxies ignore this header for proxied
connections and make use of the undocumented, non-standard Proxy-Connection
header instead. The issue begins when trying to put a load balancer between
browsers and such proxies, because there will be a difference between what
HAProxy understands and what the client and the proxy agree on.

By setting this option in a frontend, HAProxy can automatically switch to use
that non-standard header if it sees proxied requests. A proxied request is
defined here as one where the URI begins with neither a '/' nor a '*'. This
is incompatible with the HTTP tunnel mode. Note that this option can only be
specified in a frontend and will affect the request along its whole life.

Also, when this option is set, a request which requires authentication will
automatically switch to use proxy authentication headers if it is itself a
proxied request. That makes it possible to check or enforce authentication in
front of an existing proxy.

This option should normally never be used, except in front of a proxy.

          may be used, though it is not recommended to invent non-standard
          ones.

&lt;uri&gt;     is the URI referenced in the HTTP requests. It defaults to " / "
          which is accessible by default on almost any server, but may be
          changed to any other URI. Query strings are permitted.

&lt;version&gt; is the optional HTTP version string. It defaults to "HTTP/1.0"
          but some servers might behave incorrectly in HTTP 1.0, so turning
          it to HTTP/1.1 may sometimes help. Note that the Host field is
          mandatory in HTTP/1.1, use "<a href="#http-check%20send">http-check send</a>" directive to add it.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">By default, server health checks only consist in trying to establish a TCP
connection. When "<a href="#option%20httpchk">option httpchk</a>" is specified, a complete HTTP request is
sent once the TCP connection is established, and responses 2xx and 3xx are
considered valid, while all other ones indicate a server failure, including
the lack of any response.

Combined with "<a href="#http-check">http-check</a>" directives, it is possible to customize the
request sent during the HTTP health checks or the matching rules on the
response. It is also possible to configure a send/expect sequence, just like
with the directive "<a href="#option%20tcp-check">tcp-check</a>" for TCP health checks.

The server configuration is used by default to open connections to perform
HTTP health checks. By it is also possible to overwrite server parameters
using "<a href="#http-check%20connect">http-check connect</a>" rules.

"<a href="#option%20httpchk">httpchk</a>" option does not necessarily require an HTTP backend, it also works
with plain TCP backends. This is particularly useful to check simple scripts
bound to some dedicated ports using the inetd daemon. However, it will always
internally relies on an HTX multiplexer. Thus, it means the request
formatting and the response parsing will be strict.

Note : For a while, there was no way to add headers or body in the request
       used for HTTP health checks. So a workaround was to hide it at the end
       of the version string with a "\r\n" after the version. It is now
       deprecated. The directive "<a href="#http-check%20send">http-check send</a>" must be used instead.

While this default behavior is desirable for almost all applications, there
exists a situation where it is desirable to disable it, and only refresh the
read timeout if there are incoming data. This happens on sessions with large
timeouts and low amounts of exchanged data such as telnet session. If the
server suddenly disappears, the output data accumulates in the system's
socket buffers, both timeouts are correctly refreshed, and there is no way
to know the server does not receive them, so we don't timeout. However, when
the underlying protocol always echoes sent data, it would be enough by itself
to detect the issue using the read timeout. Note that this problem does not
happen with more verbose protocols because data won't accumulate long in the
socket buffers.

When this option is set on the frontend, it will disable read timeout updates

aborted connect on the server. However, it requires adding an authorization
in the MySQL table, like this :

    USE mysql;
    INSERT INTO user (Host,User) values ('&lt;ip_of_haproxy&gt;','&lt;username&gt;');
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

If you don't specify a username (it is deprecated and not recommended), the
check only consists in parsing the Mysql Handshake Initialization packet or
Error packet, we don't send anything in this mode. It was reported that it
can generate lockout if check is too frequent and/or if there is not enough
traffic. In fact, you need in this case to check MySQL "max_connect_errors"
value as if a connection is established successfully within fewer than MySQL
"max_connect_errors" attempts after a previous connection was interrupted,
the error count for the host is cleared to zero. If HAProxy's server get
blocked, the "FLUSH HOSTS" statement is the only way to unblock it.

Remember that this does not check database presence nor database consistency.
To do this, you can use an external check with xinetd for example.

The check requires MySQL &gt;=3.22, for older version, please use TCP check.

Most often, an incoming MySQL server needs to see the client's IP address for
various purposes, including IP privilege matching and connection logging.
When possible, it is often wise to masquerade the client's IP address when
connecting to the server using the "usesrc" argument of the "<span class="dropdown">source</span>" keyword,
which requires the transparent proxy feature to be compiled in, and the MySQL
server to route the client via the machine hosting HAProxy.

physically disconnected), the session timeouts triggers and the session is
closed. But it will remain in FIN_WAIT1 state for some time in the system,
using some resources and possibly limiting the ability to establish newer
connections.

When this happens, it is possible to activate "<a href="#option%20nolinger">option nolinger</a>" which forces
the system to immediately remove any socket's pending data on close. Thus,
a TCP RST is emitted, any pending data are truncated, and the session is
instantly purged from the system's tables. The generally visible effect for
a client is that responses are truncated if the close happens with a last
block of data (e.g. on a redirect or error response). On the server side,
it may help release the source ports immediately when forwarding a client
aborts in tunnels. In both cases, TCP resets are emitted and given that
the session is instantly destroyed, there will be no retransmit. On a lossy
network this can increase problems, especially when there is a firewall on
the lossy side, because the firewall might see and process the reset (hence
purge its session) and block any further traffic for this session,, including
retransmits from the other side. So if the other side doesn't receive it,
it will never receive any RST again, and the firewall might log many blocked
packets.

For all these reasons, it is strongly recommended NOT to use this option,
unless absolutely needed as a last resort. In most situations, using the
"client-fin" or "server-fin" timeouts achieves similar results with a more
reliable behavior. On Linux it's also possible to use the "<span class="dropdown">tcp-ut</span>" bind or
server setting.

This option may be used both on frontends and backends, depending on the side
where it is required. Use it on the frontend for clients, and on the backend
for servers. While this option is technically supported in "defaults"
sections, it must really not be used there as it risks to accidentally
propagate to sections that must no use it and to cause problems there.

If this option has been enabled in a "defaults" section, it can be disabled
in a specific instance by prepending the "no" keyword before it.

be redirected to the proxy and HAProxy itself can proxy every request to a
complex SQUID environment and the destination host from SO_ORIGINAL_DST will
be lost. This is annoying when you want access rules based on destination ip
addresses. To solve this problem, a new HTTP header "X-Original-To" may be
added by HAProxy to all requests sent to the server. This header contains a
value representing the original destination IP address. Since this must be
configured to always use the last occurrence of this header only. Note that
only the last occurrence of the header must be used, since it is really
possible that the client has already brought one.

The keyword "header" may be used to supply a different header name to replace
the default "X-Original-To". This can be useful where you might already
have a "X-Original-To" header from a different application, and you need
preserve it. Also if your backend server doesn't use the "X-Original-To"
header and requires different one.

Sometimes, a same HAProxy instance may be shared between a direct client
access and a reverse-proxy access (for instance when an SSL reverse-proxy is
used to decrypt HTTPS traffic). It is possible to disable the addition of the
header for a known destination address or network by adding the "except"
keyword followed by the network address. In this case, any destination IP
matching the network will not cause an addition of this header. Most common
uses are with private networks or 127.0.0.1. IPv4 and IPv6 are both
supported.

This option may be specified either in the frontend or in the backend. If at
least one of them uses it, the header will be added. Note that the backend's
setting of the header subargument takes precedence over the frontend's if
both are defined.

we only indicate a preference which HAProxy tries to apply without any form
of warranty. The real use is for keep-alive connections sent to servers. When
this option is used, HAProxy will try to reuse the same connection that is
attached to the server instead of rebalancing to another server, causing a
close of the connection. This can make sense for static file servers. It does
not make much sense to use this in combination with hashing algorithms. Note,
HAProxy already automatically tries to stick to a server which sends a 401 or
to a proxy which sends a 407 (authentication required), when the load
balancing algorithm is not deterministic. This is mandatory for use with the
broken NTLM authentication challenge, and significantly helps in
troubleshooting some faulty applications. Option prefer-last-server might be
desirable in these environments as well, to avoid redistributing the traffic

Active servers are selected from a subset of the list of available

  3. If the "<a href="#option%20allbackups">allbackups</a>" option is set, any backup server.

When a retry occurs, HAProxy tries to select another server than the last
one. The new server is selected from the current list of servers.

Sometimes, if the list is updated between retries (e.g., if numerous retries
occur and last longer than the time needed to check that a server is down,
remove it from the list and fall back on the list of backup servers),
connections may be redirected to a backup server, though.

It also allows to retry connections to another server in case of multiple

connections followed by an SMTP command. By default, this command is
"HELO localhost". The server's return code is analyzed and only return codes
starting with a "2" will be considered as valid. All other responses,
including a lack of response will constitute an error and will indicate a
dead server.

This test is meant to be used with SMTP servers or relays. Depending on the
request, it is possible that some servers do not log each connection attempt,
so you may want to experiment to improve the behavior. Using telnet on port
25 is often easier than adjusting the configuration.

Most often, an incoming SMTP server needs to see the client's IP address for
various purposes, including spam filtering, anti-spoofing and logging. When
possible, it is often wise to masquerade the client's IP address when
connecting to the server using the "usesrc" argument of the "<span class="dropdown">source</span>" keyword,
which requires the transparent proxy feature to be compiled in.

Important note: kernel-based TCP splicing is a Linux-specific feature which
first appeared in kernel 2.6.25. It offers kernel-based acceleration to
transfer data between sockets without copying these data to user-space, thus
providing noticeable performance gains and CPU cycles savings. Since many
early implementations are buggy, corrupt data and/or are inefficient, this
feature is not enabled by default, and it should be used with extreme care.
While it is not possible to detect the correctness of an implementation,
2.6.29 is the first version offering a properly working implementation. In

Enabling socket-level TCP keep-alives makes the system regularly send packets
to the other end of the connection, leaving it active. The delay between
keep-alive probes is controlled by the system only and depends both on the
operating system and its tuning parameters.

It is important to understand that keep-alive packets are neither emitted nor
received at the application level. It is only the network stacks which sees
them. For this reason, even if one side of the proxy already uses keep-alives
to maintain its connection alive, those keep-alive packets will not be
forwarded to the other side of the proxy.

Please note that this has nothing to do with HTTP keep-alive.

Using option "<a href="#option%20srvtcpka">srvtcpka</a>" enables the emission of TCP keep-alive probes on the
server side of a connection, which should help when session expirations are
noticed between HAProxy and a server.

All servers tested till there correctly reply to SSLv3 client hello messages,

</div> <pre class="text">This health check method is intended to be combined with "<a href="#option%20tcp-check">tcp-check</a>" command
lists in order to support send/expect types of health check sequences.

TCP checks currently support 4 modes of operations :
  - no "<a href="#option%20tcp-check">tcp-check</a>" directive : the health check only consists in a connection
    attempt, which remains the default mode.

  - "<a href="#tcp-check%20send">tcp-check send</a>" or "<a href="#tcp-check%20send-binary">tcp-check send-binary</a>" only is mentioned : this is
    used to send a string along with a connection opening. With some
    protocols, it helps sending a "QUIT" message for example that prevents
    the server from logging a connection error for each health check. The
    check result will still be based on the ability to open the connection
    only.

  - "<a href="#tcp-check%20expect">tcp-check expect</a>" only is mentioned : this is used to test a banner.
    The connection is opened and HAProxy waits for the server to present some
    contents which must validate some rules. The check result will be based
    on the matching between the contents and the rules. This is suited for
    POP, IMAP, SMTP, FTP, SSH, TELNET.

  - both "<a href="#tcp-check%20send">tcp-check send</a>" and "<a href="#tcp-check%20expect">tcp-check expect</a>" are mentioned : this is
    used to test a hello-type protocol. HAProxy sends a message, the server
    responds and its response is analyzed. the check result will be based on
    the matching between the response contents and the rules. This is often
    suited for protocols which require a binding or a request/response model.
    LDAP, MySQL, Redis and SSL are example of such protocols, though they
    already all have their dedicated checks with a deeper understanding of
    the respective protocols.
    In this mode, many questions may be sent and many answers may be
    analyzed.

A fifth mode can be used to insert comments in different steps of the script.

For each tcp-check rule you create, you can add a "comment" directive,
followed by a string. This string will be reported in the log and stderr in
debug mode. It is useful to make user-friendly error reporting.  The
"comment" is of course optional.

During the execution of a health check, a variable scope is made available to
store data samples, using the "<a href="#tcp-check%20set-var">tcp-check set-var</a>" operation. Freeing those
variable is possible using "<a href="#tcp-check%20unset-var">tcp-check unset-var</a>".

behalf of HAProxy, then the client immediately sends its request, and the
system acknowledges it too while it is notifying HAProxy about the new
connection. HAProxy then reads the request and responds. This means that we
have one TCP ACK sent by the system for nothing, because the request could
very well be acknowledged by HAProxy when it sends its response.

For this reason, in HTTP mode, HAProxy automatically asks the system to avoid
sending this useless ACK on platforms which support it (currently at least
Linux). It must not cause any problem, because the system will send it anyway
after 40 ms if the response takes more time than expected to come.

During complex network debugging sessions, it may be desirable to disable
this optimization because delayed ACKs can make troubleshooting more complex
when trying to identify where packets are delayed. It is then possible to
fall back to normal behavior by specifying "<a href="#no%20option%20tcp-smart-accept">no option tcp-smart-accept</a>".

It is also possible to force it for non-HTTP proxies by simply specifying
"<a href="#option%20tcp-smart-accept">option tcp-smart-accept</a>". For instance, it can make sense with some services
such as SMTP where the server speaks first.

It is recommended to avoid forcing this option in a defaults section. In case
of doubt, consider setting it back to automatic values by prepending the
"default" keyword before it, or disabling it using the "no" keyword.

will have the string value "NOT_USED".

Some values are also provided through environment variables.

Environment variables :
  HAPROXY_PROXY_ADDR      The first bind address if available (or empty if not
                          applicable, for example in a "backend" section).

  HAPROXY_PROXY_ID        The backend id.

  HAPROXY_PROXY_NAME      The backend name.

  HAPROXY_PROXY_PORT      The first bind port if available (or empty if not
                          applicable, for example in a "backend" section or
                          for a UNIX socket).

  HAPROXY_SERVER_ADDR     The server address.

  HAPROXY_SERVER_CURCONN  The current number of connections on the server.

  HAPROXY_SERVER_ID       The server id.

  HAPROXY_SERVER_MAXCONN  The server max connections.

  HAPROXY_SERVER_NAME     The server name.

  HAPROXY_SERVER_PORT     The server port if available (or empty for a UNIX
                          socket).

  PATH                    The PATH environment variable used when executing
                          the command may be set using "<a href="#external-check%20path">external-check path</a>".

See also "2.3. Environment variables" for other variables.

If the command executed and exits with a zero status then the check is
considered to have passed, otherwise the check is considered to have
failed.

contains all information required to find the server in the list of known

which is still UP (or if "<a href="#option%20persist">option persist</a>" is set), then the connection is
forwarded to this server.

Note that this only makes sense in a TCP backend, but for this to work, the
frontend must have waited long enough to ensure that an RDP cookie is present
in the request buffer. This is the same requirement as with the "rdp-cookie"
load-balancing method. Thus it is highly recommended to put all statements in
a single "listen" section.

Also, it is important to understand that the terminal server will emit this
RDP cookie only if it is configured for "token redirection mode", which means
that the "IP address redirection" option is disabled.

sense to increase the socket's backlog using the "<span class="dropdown">backlog</span>" keyword.

This feature is particularly efficient at blocking connection-based attacks

          the HTTP "Location" header. When used in an "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" rule,
          &lt;loc&gt; value follows the log-format rules and can include some
          dynamic values (see Custom Log Format in <a href="#8.2.4">section 8.2.4</a>).

&lt;pfx&gt;     With "<a href="#redirect%20prefix">redirect prefix</a>", the "Location" header is built from the
          concatenation of &lt;pfx&gt; and the complete URI path, including the
          query string, unless the "drop-query" option is specified (see
          below). As a special case, if &lt;pfx&gt; equals exactly "/", then
          nothing is inserted before the original URI. It allows one to
          redirect to the same URL (for instance, to insert a cookie). When
          used in an "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" rule, &lt;pfx&gt; value follows the log-format
          rules and can include some dynamic values (see Custom Log Format
          in <a href="#8.2.4">section 8.2.4</a>).

&lt;sch&gt;     With "<a href="#redirect%20scheme">redirect scheme</a>", then the "Location" header is built by
          concatenating &lt;sch&gt; with "://" then the first occurrence of the
          "Host" header, and then the URI path, including the query string
          unless the "drop-query" option is specified (see below). If no
          path is found or if the path is "*", then "/" is used instead. If
          no "Host" header is found, then an empty host component will be
          returned, which most recent browsers interpret as redirecting to
          the same host. This directive is mostly used to redirect HTTP to
          HTTPS. When used in an "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" rule, &lt;sch&gt; value follows
          the log-format rules and can include some dynamic values (see
          Custom Log Format in <a href="#8.2.4">section 8.2.4</a>).

&lt;code&gt;    The code is optional. It indicates which type of HTTP redirection
          is desired. Only codes 301, 302, 303, 307 and 308 are supported,
          with 302 used by default if no code is specified. 301 means
          "Moved permanently", and a browser may cache the Location. 302
          means "Moved temporarily" and means that the browser should not
          cache the redirection. 303 is equivalent to 302 except that the
          browser will fetch the location with a GET method. 307 is just
          like 302 but makes it clear that the same method must be reused.
          Likewise, 308 replaces 301 if the same method must be used.

&lt;option&gt;  There are several options which can be specified to adjust the
          expected behavior of a redirection :

  - "drop-query"
    When this keyword is used in a prefix-based redirection, then the
    location will be set without any possible query-string, which is useful
    for directing users to a non-secure page for instance. It has no effect
    with a location-type redirect.

  - "append-slash"
    This keyword may be used in conjunction with "drop-query" to redirect
    users who use a URL not ending with a '/' to the same one with the '/'.
    It can be useful to ensure that search engines will only see one URL.
    For this, a return code 301 is preferred.

  - "set-cookie NAME[=value]"
    A "Set-Cookie" header will be added with NAME (and optionally "=value")
    to the response. This is sometimes used to indicate that a user has
    been seen, for instance to protect against some types of DoS. No other
    cookie option is added, so the cookie will be a session cookie. Note
    that for a browser, a sole cookie name without an equal sign is
    different from a cookie with an equal sign.

  - "clear-cookie NAME[=]"
    A "Set-Cookie" header will be added with NAME (and optionally "="), but
    with the "Max-Age" attribute set to zero. This will tell the browser to
    delete this cookie. It is useful for instance on logout pages. It is
    important to note that clearing the cookie "NAME" will not remove a
    cookie set with "NAME=value". You have to clear the cookie "NAME=" for
    that, because the browser makes the difference.</pre> </div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example:</span> <pre class="prettyprint">

            type of failure event on which an attempt to retry the request
            is desired. Please read the notes at the bottom before changing
            this setting. The following keywords are supported :

  none              never retry

  conn-failure      retry when the connection or the SSL handshake failed
                    and the request could not be sent. This is the default.

  empty-response    retry when the server connection was closed after part
                    of the request was sent, and nothing was received from
                    the server. This type of failure may be caused by the
                    request timeout on the server side, poor network
                    condition, or a server crash or restart while
                    processing the request.

  junk-response     retry when the server returned something not looking
                    like a complete HTTP response. This includes partial
                    responses headers as well as non-HTTP contents. It
                    usually is a bad idea to retry on such events, which
                    may be caused a configuration issue (wrong server port)
                    or by the request being harmful to the server (buffer
                    overflow attack for example).

  response-timeout  the server timeout stroke while waiting for the server
                    to respond to the request. This may be caused by poor
                    network condition, the reuse of an idle connection
                    which has expired on the path, or by the request being
                    extremely expensive to process. It generally is a bad
                    idea to retry on such events on servers dealing with
                    heavy database processing (full scans, etc) as it may
                    amplify denial of service attacks.

  0rtt-rejected     retry requests which were sent over early data and were
                    rejected by the server. These requests are generally
                    considered to be safe to retry.

  &lt;status&gt;          any HTTP status code among "401" (Unauthorized), "403"
                    (Forbidden), "404" (Not Found), "408" (Request Timeout),
                    "425" (Too Early), "500" (Server Error), "501" (Not
                    Implemented), "502" (Bad Gateway), "503" (Service
                    Unavailable), "504" (Gateway Timeout).

  all-retryable-errors
                    retry request for any error that are considered
                    retryable. This currently activates "conn-failure",
                    "empty-response", "junk-response", "response-timeout",
                    "0rtt-rejected", "500", "502", "503", and "504".</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Using this directive replaces any previous settings with the new ones; it is
not cumulative.

Please note that using anything other than "none" and "conn-failure" requires
to allocate a buffer and copy the whole request into it, so it has memory and
performance impacts. Requests not fitting in a single buffer will never be
retried (see the global tune.bufsize setting).

You have to make sure the application has a replay protection mechanism built
in such as a unique transaction IDs passed in requests, or that replaying the
same request has no consequence, or it is very dangerous to use any retry-on
value beside "conn-failure" and "none". Static file servers and caches are
generally considered safe against any type of retry. Using a status code can
be useful to quickly leave a server showing an abnormal behavior (out of
memory, file system issues, etc), but in this case it may be a good idea to
immediately redispatch the connection to another server (please see "option
redispatch" for this). Last, it is important to understand that most causes
of failures are the requests themselves and that retrying a request causing a
server to misbehave will often make the situation even worse for this server,
or for the whole service in case of redispatch.

Unless you know exactly how the application deals with replayed requests, you
should not use this directive.

The default is "conn-failure".

          used before the address to force the family regardless of the
          address format, which can be useful to specify a path to a unix
          socket with no slash ('/'). Currently supported prefixes are :
                - 'ipv4@'  -&gt; address is always IPv4
                - 'ipv6@'  -&gt; address is always IPv6
                - 'unix@'  -&gt; address is a path to a local unix socket
                - 'abns@'  -&gt; address is in abstract namespace (Linux only)
                - 'sockpair@' -&gt; address is the FD of a connected unix
                  socket or of a socketpair. During a connection, the
                  backend creates a pair of connected sockets, and passes
                  one of them over the FD. The bind part will use the
                  received socket as the client FD. Should be used
                  carefully.
          You may want to reference some environment variables in the
          address parameter, see <a href="#2.3">section 2.3</a> about environment
          variables. The "<a href="#init-addr">init-addr</a>" setting can be used to modify the way
          IP addresses should be resolved upon startup.

&lt;port&gt;    is an optional port specification. If set, all connections will
          be sent to this port. If unset, the same port the client
          connected to will be used. The port may also be prefixed by a "+"
          or a "-". In this case, the server's port will be determined by
          adding this value to the client's port.

          accepts an important number of options and has a complete section

          server. This address is also used as a source for health checks.

          The default value of 0.0.0.0 means that the system will select
          the most appropriate address to reach its destination. Optionally
          an address family prefix may be used before the address to force
          the family regardless of the address format, which can be useful
          to specify a path to a unix socket with no slash ('/'). Currently
          supported prefixes are :
            - 'ipv4@' -&gt; address is always IPv4
            - 'ipv6@' -&gt; address is always IPv6
            - 'unix@' -&gt; address is a path to a local unix socket
            - 'abns@' -&gt; address is in abstract namespace (Linux only)
          You may want to reference some environment variables in the
          address parameter, see <a href="#2.3">section 2.3</a> about environment variables.

&lt;port&gt;    is an optional port. It is normally not needed but may be useful
          in some very specific contexts. The default value of zero means
          the system will select a free port. Note that port ranges are not
          supported in the backend. If you want to force port ranges, you
          have to specify them on each "<span class="dropdown">server</span>" line.

&lt;addr2&gt;   is the IP address to present to the server when connections are
          forwarded in full transparent proxy mode. This is currently only
          supported on some patched Linux kernels. When this address is
          specified, clients connecting to the server will be presented
          with this address, while health checks will still use the address
          &lt;addr&gt;.

&lt;port2&gt;   is the optional port to present to the server when connections
          are forwarded in full transparent proxy mode (see &lt;addr2&gt; above).
          The default value of zero means the system will select a free
          port.

&lt;hdr&gt;     is the name of a HTTP header in which to fetch the IP to bind to.
          This is the name of a comma-separated header list which can
          contain multiple IP addresses. By default, the last occurrence is
          used. This is designed to work with the X-Forwarded-For header
          and to automatically bind to the client's IP address as seen
          by previous proxy, typically Stunnel. In order to use another
          occurrence from the last one, please see the &lt;occ&gt; parameter
          below. When the header (or occurrence) is not found, no binding
          is performed so that the proxy's default IP address is used. Also
          keep in mind that the header name is case insensitive, as for any
          HTTP header.

&lt;occ&gt;     is the occurrence number of a value to be used in a multi-value
          header. This is to be used in conjunction with "hdr_ip(&lt;hdr&gt;)",
          in order to specify which occurrence to use for the source IP
          address. Positive values indicate a position from the first
          occurrence, 1 being the first one. Negative values indicate
          positions relative to the last one, -1 being the last one. This
          is helpful for situations where an X-Forwarded-For header is set
          at the entry point of an infrastructure and must be used several
          proxy layers away. When this value is not specified, -1 is
          assumed. Passing a zero here disables the feature.

&lt;name&gt;    is an optional interface name to which to bind to for outgoing
          traffic. On systems supporting this features (currently, only
          Linux), this allows one to bind all traffic to the server to
          this interface even if it is not the one the system would select
          based on routing tables. This should be used with extreme care.
          Note that using this option requires root privileges.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">The "<span class="dropdown">source</span>" keyword is useful in complex environments where a specific
address only is allowed to connect to the servers. It may be needed when a
private address must be used through a public gateway for instance, and it is
known that the system cannot determine the adequate source address by itself.

An extension which is available on certain patched Linux kernels may be used
through the "usesrc" optional keyword. It makes it possible to connect to the
servers with an IP address which does not belong to the system itself. This
is called "full transparent proxy mode". For this to work, the destination
servers have to route their traffic back to this address through the machine
running HAProxy, and IP forwarding must generally be enabled on this machine.

In this "full transparent proxy" mode, it is possible to force a specific IP
address to be presented to the servers. This is not much used in fact. A more
common use is to tell HAProxy to present the client's IP address. For this,
there are two methods :

  - present the client's IP and port addresses. This is the most transparent
    mode, but it can cause problems when IP connection tracking is enabled on
    the machine, because a same connection may be seen twice with different
    states. However, this solution presents the huge advantage of not
    limiting the system to the 64k outgoing address+port couples, because all
    of the client ranges may be used.

  - present only the client's IP address and select a spare port. This
    solution is still quite elegant but slightly less transparent (downstream
    firewalls logs will not match upstream's). It also presents the downside
    of limiting the number of concurrent connections to the usual 64k ports.
    However, since the upstream and downstream ports are different, local IP
    connection tracking on the machine will not be upset by the reuse of the
    same session.

This option sets the default source for all servers in the backend. It may
also be specified in a "defaults" section. Finer source address specification
is possible at the server level using the "<span class="dropdown">source</span>" server option. Refer to
<a href="#5">section 5</a> for more information.

In order to work, "usesrc" requires root privileges.

page within the normal application. It is strongly advised to ensure that the
selected URI will never appear in the application, otherwise it will never be
possible to reach it in the application.

The default URI compiled in HAProxy is "/haproxy?stats", but this may be
changed at build time, so it's better to always explicitly specify it here.
It is generally a good idea to include a question mark in the URI so that
intermediate proxies refrain from caching the results. Also, since any string
beginning with the prefix will be accepted as a stats request, the question
mark helps ensuring that no valid URI will begin with the same words.

It is sometimes very convenient to use "/" as the URI prefix, and put that
statement in a "listen" instance of its own. That makes it easy to dedicate
an address or a port to statistics only.

           describes what elements of the incoming request or connection
           will be analyzed in the hope to find a matching entry in a
           stickiness table. This rule is mandatory.

&lt;table&gt;    is an optional stickiness table name. If unspecified, the same
           backend's table is used. A stickiness table is declared using
           the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement.

&lt;cond&gt;     is an optional matching condition. It makes it possible to match
           on a certain criterion only when other conditions are met (or
           not met). For instance, it could be used to match on a source IP
           address except when a request passes through a known proxy, in
           which case we'd match on a header containing that IP address.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Some protocols or applications require complex stickiness rules and cannot
always simply rely on cookies nor hashing. The "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>" statement
describes a rule to extract the stickiness criterion from an incoming request
or connection. See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for a complete list of possible patterns and
transformation rules.

The table has to be declared using the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement. It must be of
a type compatible with the pattern. By default it is the one which is present
in the same backend. It is possible to share a table with other backends by
referencing it using the "<a href="#table">table</a>" keyword. If another table is referenced,
the server's ID inside the backends are used. By default, all server IDs
start at 1 in each backend, so the server ordering is enough. But in case of
doubt, it is highly recommended to force server IDs using their "<span class="dropdown">id</span>" setting.

It is possible to restrict the conditions where a "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>" statement
will apply, using "if" or "unless" followed by a condition. See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for
ACL based conditions.

There is no limit on the number of "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>" statements. The first that
applies and matches will cause the request to be directed to the same server
as was used for the request which created the entry. That way, multiple
matches can be used as fallbacks.

The stick rules are checked after the persistence cookies, so they will not
affect stickiness if a cookie has already been used to select a server. That
way, it becomes very easy to insert cookies and match on IP addresses in
order to maintain stickiness between HTTP and HTTPS.

Note : Consider not using this feature in multi-process mode (nbproc &gt; 1)
       unless you know what you do : memory is not shared between the
       processes, which can result in random behaviors.

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span><pre class="prettyprint arguments">&lt;pattern&gt;  is a sample expression rule as described in <a href="#7.3">section 7.3</a>. It
           describes what elements of the incoming request or connection
           will be analyzed, extracted and stored in the table once a
           server is selected.

&lt;table&gt;    is an optional stickiness table name. If unspecified, the same
           backend's table is used. A stickiness table is declared using
           the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement.

&lt;cond&gt;     is an optional storage condition. It makes it possible to store
           certain criteria only when some conditions are met (or not met).
           For instance, it could be used to store the source IP address
           except when the request passes through a known proxy, in which
           case we'd store a converted form of a header containing that IP
           address.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Some protocols or applications require complex stickiness rules and cannot
always simply rely on cookies nor hashing. The "<a href="#stick%20store-request">stick store-request</a>" statement
describes a rule to decide what to extract from the request and when to do
it, in order to store it into a stickiness table for further requests to
match it using the "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>" statement. Obviously the extracted part must
make sense and have a chance to be matched in a further request. Storing a
client's IP address for instance often makes sense. Storing an ID found in a
URL parameter also makes sense. Storing a source port will almost never make
any sense because it will be randomly matched. See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for a complete
list of possible patterns and transformation rules.

The table has to be declared using the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement. It must be of
a type compatible with the pattern. By default it is the one which is present
in the same backend. It is possible to share a table with other backends by
referencing it using the "<a href="#table">table</a>" keyword. If another table is referenced,
the server's ID inside the backends are used. By default, all server IDs
start at 1 in each backend, so the server ordering is enough. But in case of
doubt, it is highly recommended to force server IDs using their "<span class="dropdown">id</span>" setting.

It is possible to restrict the conditions where a "<a href="#stick%20store-request">stick store-request</a>"
statement will apply, using "if" or "unless" followed by a condition. This
condition will be evaluated while parsing the request, so any criteria can be
used. See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for ACL based conditions.

There is no limit on the number of "<a href="#stick%20store-request">stick store-request</a>" statements, but
there is a limit of 8 simultaneous stores per request or response. This
makes it possible to store up to 8 criteria, all extracted from either the
request or the response, regardless of the number of rules. Only the 8 first
ones which match will be kept. Using this, it is possible to feed multiple
tables at once in the hope to increase the chance to recognize a user on
another protocol or access method. Using multiple store-request rules with
the same table is possible and may be used to find the best criterion to rely
on, by arranging the rules by decreasing preference order. Only the first
extracted criterion for a given table will be stored. All subsequent store-
request rules referencing the same table will be skipped and their ACLs will
not be evaluated.

The "store-request" rules are evaluated once the server connection has been
established, so that the table will contain the real server that processed
the request.

Note : Consider not using this feature in multi-process mode (nbproc &gt; 1)
       unless you know what you do : memory is not shared between the
       processes, which can result in random behaviors.

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span><pre class="prettyprint arguments"> ip         a table declared with "type ip" will only store IPv4 addresses.
            This form is very compact (about 50 bytes per entry) and allows
            very fast entry lookup and stores with almost no overhead. This
            is mainly used to store client source IP addresses.

 ipv6       a table declared with "type ipv6" will only store IPv6 addresses.
            This form is very compact (about 60 bytes per entry) and allows
            very fast entry lookup and stores with almost no overhead. This
            is mainly used to store client source IP addresses.

 integer    a table declared with "type integer" will store 32bit integers
            which can represent a client identifier found in a request for
            instance.

 string     a table declared with "type string" will store substrings of up
            to &lt;len&gt; characters. If the string provided by the pattern
            extractor is larger than &lt;len&gt;, it will be truncated before
            being stored. During matching, at most &lt;len&gt; characters will be
            compared between the string in the table and the extracted
            pattern. When not specified, the string is automatically limited
            to 32 characters.

 binary     a table declared with "type binary" will store binary blocks
            of &lt;len&gt; bytes. If the block provided by the pattern
            extractor is larger than &lt;len&gt;, it will be truncated before
            being stored. If the block provided by the sample expression
            is shorter than &lt;len&gt;, it will be padded by 0. When not
            specified, the block is automatically limited to 32 bytes.

 &lt;length&gt;   is the maximum number of characters that will be stored in a
            "string" type table (See type "string" above). Or the number
            of bytes of the block in "binary" type table. Be careful when
            changing this parameter as memory usage will proportionally
            increase.

 &lt;size&gt;     is the maximum number of entries that can fit in the table. This
            value directly impacts memory usage. Count approximately
            50 bytes per entry, plus the size of a string if any. The size
            supports suffixes "k", "m", "g" for 2^10, 2^20 and 2^30 factors.

 [nopurge]  indicates that we refuse to purge older entries when the table
            is full. When not specified and the table is full when HAProxy
            wants to store an entry in it, it will flush a few of the oldest
            entries in order to release some space for the new ones. This is
            most often the desired behavior. In some specific cases, it
            be desirable to refuse new entries instead of purging the older
            ones. That may be the case when the amount of data to store is
            far above the hardware limits and we prefer not to offer access
            to new clients than to reject the ones already connected. When
            using this parameter, be sure to properly set the "expire"
            parameter (see below).

 &lt;peersect&gt; is the name of the peers section to use for replication. Entries
            which associate keys to server IDs are kept synchronized with
            the remote peers declared in this section. All entries are also
            automatically learned from the local peer (old process) during a
            soft restart.

            NOTE : each peers section may be referenced only by tables
                   belonging to the same unique process.

 &lt;expire&gt;   defines the maximum duration of an entry in the table since it
            was last created, refreshed or matched. The expiration delay is
            defined using the standard time format, similarly as the various
            timeouts. The maximum duration is slightly above 24 days. See
            <a href="#2.5">section 2.5</a> for more information. If this delay is not specified,
            the session won't automatically expire, but older entries will
            be removed once full. Be sure not to use the "nopurge" parameter
            if not expiration delay is specified.

 &lt;srvkey&gt;   specifies how each server is identified for the purposes of the
            stick table. The valid values are "<a href="#name">name</a>" and "<a href="#addr">addr</a>". If "<a href="#name">name</a>" is
            given, then &lt;name&gt; argument for the server (may be generated by
            a template). If "<a href="#addr">addr</a>" is given, then the server is identified
            by its current network address, including the port. "<a href="#addr">addr</a>" is
            especially useful if you are using service discovery to generate
            the addresses for servers with peered stick-tables and want
            to consistently use the same host across peers for a stickiness
            token.

&lt;data_type&gt; is used to store additional information in the stick-table. This
            may be used by ACLs in order to control various criteria related
            to the activity of the client matching the stick-table. For each
            item specified here, the size of each entry will be inflated so
            that the additional data can fit. Several data types may be
            stored with an entry. Multiple data types may be specified after
            the "store" keyword, as a comma-separated list. Alternatively,
            it is possible to repeat the "store" keyword followed by one or
            several data types. Except for the "server_id" type which is
            automatically detected and enabled, all data types must be
            explicitly declared to be stored. If an ACL references a data
            type which is not stored, the ACL will simply not match. Some
            data types require an argument which must be passed just after
            the type between parenthesis. See below for the supported data
            types and their arguments.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">The data types that can be stored with an entry are the following :
  - server_id : this is an integer which holds the numeric ID of the server a
    request was assigned to. It is used by the "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>", "stick store",
    and "<a href="#stick%20on">stick on</a>" rules. It is automatically enabled when referenced.

  - gpc0 : first General Purpose Counter. It is a positive 32-bit integer
    integer which may be used for anything. Most of the time it will be used
    to put a special tag on some entries, for instance to note that a
    specific behavior was detected and must be known for future matches.

  - gpc0_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : increment rate of the first General Purpose Counter
    over a period. It is a positive 32-bit integer integer which may be used
    for anything. Just like &lt;gpc0&gt;, it counts events, but instead of keeping
    a cumulative number, it maintains the rate at which the counter is
    incremented. Most of the time it will be used to measure the frequency of
    occurrence of certain events (e.g. requests to a specific URL).

  - gpc1 : second General Purpose Counter. It is a positive 32-bit integer
    integer which may be used for anything. Most of the time it will be used
    to put a special tag on some entries, for instance to note that a
    specific behavior was detected and must be known for future matches.

  - gpc1_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : increment rate of the second General Purpose Counter
    over a period. It is a positive 32-bit integer integer which may be used
    for anything. Just like &lt;gpc1&gt;, it counts events, but instead of keeping
    a cumulative number, it maintains the rate at which the counter is
    incremented. Most of the time it will be used to measure the frequency of
    occurrence of certain events (e.g. requests to a specific URL).

  - conn_cnt : Connection Count. It is a positive 32-bit integer which counts
    the absolute number of connections received from clients which matched
    this entry. It does not mean the connections were accepted, just that
    they were received.

  - conn_cur : Current Connections. It is a positive 32-bit integer which
    stores the concurrent connection counts for the entry. It is incremented
    once an incoming connection matches the entry, and decremented once the
    connection leaves. That way it is possible to know at any time the exact
    number of concurrent connections for an entry.

  - conn_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes an
    integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    incoming connection rate over that period, in connections per period. The
    result is an integer which can be matched using ACLs.

  - sess_cnt : Session Count. It is a positive 32-bit integer which counts
    the absolute number of sessions received from clients which matched this
    entry. A session is a connection that was accepted by the layer 4 rules.

  - sess_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes an
    integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    incoming session rate over that period, in sessions per period. The
    result is an integer which can be matched using ACLs.

  - http_req_cnt : HTTP request Count. It is a positive 32-bit integer which
    counts the absolute number of HTTP requests received from clients which
    matched this entry. It does not matter whether they are valid requests or
    not. Note that this is different from sessions when keep-alive is used on
    the client side.

  - http_req_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes an
    integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    HTTP request rate over that period, in requests per period. The result is
    an integer which can be matched using ACLs. It does not matter whether
    they are valid requests or not. Note that this is different from sessions
    when keep-alive is used on the client side.

  - http_err_cnt : HTTP Error Count. It is a positive 32-bit integer which
    counts the absolute number of HTTP requests errors induced by clients
    which matched this entry. Errors are counted on invalid and truncated
    requests, as well as on denied or tarpitted requests, and on failed
    authentications. If the server responds with 4xx, then the request is
    also counted as an error since it's an error triggered by the client
    (e.g. vulnerability scan).

  - http_err_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes an
    integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    HTTP request error rate over that period, in requests per period (see
    http_err_cnt above for what is accounted as an error). The result is an
    integer which can be matched using ACLs.

  - http_fail_cnt : HTTP Failure Count. It is a positive 32-bit integer which
    counts the absolute number of HTTP response failures induced by servers
    which matched this entry. Errors are counted on invalid and truncated
    responses, as well as any 5xx response other than 501 or 505. It aims at
    being used combined with path or URI to detect service failures.

  - http_fail_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes
    an integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    HTTP response failure rate over that period, in requests per period (see
    http_fail_cnt above for what is accounted as a failure). The result is an
    integer which can be matched using ACLs.

  - bytes_in_cnt : client to server byte count. It is a positive 64-bit
    integer which counts the cumulative number of bytes received from clients
    which matched this entry. Headers are included in the count. This may be
    used to limit abuse of upload features on photo or video servers.

  - bytes_in_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes an
    integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    incoming bytes rate over that period, in bytes per period. It may be used
    to detect users which upload too much and too fast. Warning: with large
    uploads, it is possible that the amount of uploaded data will be counted
    once upon termination, thus causing spikes in the average transfer speed
    instead of having a smooth one. This may partially be smoothed with
    "<a href="#option%20contstats">option contstats</a>" though this is not perfect yet. Use of byte_in_cnt is
    recommended for better fairness.

  - bytes_out_cnt : server to client byte count. It is a positive 64-bit
    integer which counts the cumulative number of bytes sent to clients which
    matched this entry. Headers are included in the count. This may be used
    to limit abuse of bots sucking the whole site.

  - bytes_out_rate(&lt;period&gt;) : frequency counter (takes 12 bytes). It takes
    an integer parameter &lt;period&gt; which indicates in milliseconds the length
    of the period over which the average is measured. It reports the average
    outgoing bytes rate over that period, in bytes per period. It may be used
    to detect users which download too much and too fast. Warning: with large
    transfers, it is possible that the amount of transferred data will be
    counted once upon termination, thus causing spikes in the average
    transfer speed instead of having a smooth one. This may partially be
    smoothed with "<a href="#option%20contstats">option contstats</a>" though this is not perfect yet. Use of
    byte_out_cnt is recommended for better fairness.

There is only one stick-table per proxy. At the moment of writing this doc,
it does not seem useful to have multiple tables per proxy. If this happens
to be required, simply create a dummy backend with a stick-table in it and
reference it.

It is important to understand that stickiness based on learning information
has some limitations, including the fact that all learned associations are
lost upon restart unless peers are properly configured to transfer such
information upon restart (recommended). In general it can be good as a
complement but not always as an exclusive stickiness.

Last, memory requirements may be important when storing many data types.
Indeed, storing all indicators above at once in each entry requires 116 bytes
per entry, or 116 MB for a 1-million entries table. This is definitely not
something that can be ignored.

</div> <div class="separator"> <span class="label label-info">Arguments :</span><pre class="prettyprint arguments">&lt;pattern&gt;  is a sample expression rule as described in <a href="#7.3">section 7.3</a>. It
           describes what elements of the response or connection will
           be analyzed, extracted and stored in the table once a
           server is selected.

&lt;table&gt;    is an optional stickiness table name. If unspecified, the same
           backend's table is used. A stickiness table is declared using
           the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement.

&lt;cond&gt;     is an optional storage condition. It makes it possible to store
           certain criteria only when some conditions are met (or not met).
           For instance, it could be used to store the SSL session ID only
           when the response is a SSL server hello.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Some protocols or applications require complex stickiness rules and cannot
always simply rely on cookies nor hashing. The "<a href="#stick%20store-response">stick store-response</a>"
statement  describes a rule to decide what to extract from the response and
when to do it, in order to store it into a stickiness table for further
requests to match it using the "<a href="#stick%20match">stick match</a>" statement. Obviously the
extracted part must make sense and have a chance to be matched in a further
request. Storing an ID found in a header of a response makes sense.
See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for a complete list of possible patterns and transformation
rules.

The table has to be declared using the "<a href="#stick-table">stick-table</a>" statement. It must be of
a type compatible with the pattern. By default it is the one which is present
in the same backend. It is possible to share a table with other backends by
referencing it using the "<a href="#table">table</a>" keyword. If another table is referenced,
the server's ID inside the backends are used. By default, all server IDs
start at 1 in each backend, so the server ordering is enough. But in case of
doubt, it is highly recommended to force server IDs using their "<span class="dropdown">id</span>" setting.

It is possible to restrict the conditions where a "<a href="#stick%20store-response">stick store-response</a>"
statement will apply, using "if" or "unless" followed by a condition. This
condition will be evaluated while parsing the response, so any criteria can
be used. See <a href="#7">section 7</a> for ACL based conditions.

There is no limit on the number of "<a href="#stick%20store-response">stick store-response</a>" statements, but
there is a limit of 8 simultaneous stores per request or response. This
makes it possible to store up to 8 criteria, all extracted from either the
request or the response, regardless of the number of rules. Only the 8 first
ones which match will be kept. Using this, it is possible to feed multiple
tables at once in the hope to increase the chance to recognize a user on
another protocol or access method. Using multiple store-response rules with
the same table is possible and may be used to find the best criterion to rely
on, by arranging the rules by decreasing preference order. Only the first
extracted criterion for a given table will be stored. All subsequent store-
response rules referencing the same table will be skipped and their ACLs will
not be evaluated. However, even if a store-request rule references a table, a
store-response rule may also use the same table. This means that each table
may learn exactly one element from the request and one element from the
response at once.

The table will contain the real server that processed the request.

min-recv  is optional and can define the minimum amount of data required to
          evaluate the current expect rule. If the number of received bytes
          is under this limit, the check will wait for more data. This
          option can be used to resolve some ambiguous matching rules or to
          avoid executing costly regex matches on content known to be still
          incomplete. If an exact string (string or binary) is used, the
          minimum between the string length and this parameter is used.
          This parameter is ignored if it is set to -1. If the expect rule
          does not match, the check will wait for more data. If set to 0,
          the evaluation result is always conclusive.

&lt;match&gt;   is a keyword indicating how to look for a specific pattern in the
          response. The keyword may be one of "string", "rstring", "binary" or
          "rbinary".
          The keyword may be preceded by an exclamation mark ("!") to negate
          the match. Spaces are allowed between the exclamation mark and the
          keyword. See below for more details on the supported keywords.

ok-status &lt;st&gt;     is optional and can be used to set the check status if
                   the expect rule is successfully evaluated and if it is
                   the last rule in the tcp-check ruleset. "L7OK", "L7OKC",
                   "L6OK" and "L4OK" are supported :
                     - L7OK  : check passed on layer 7
                     - L7OKC : check conditionally passed on layer 7, set
                               server to NOLB state.
                     - L6OK  : check passed on layer 6
                     - L4OK  : check passed on layer 4
                    By default "L7OK" is used.

error-status &lt;st&gt;  is optional and can be used to set the check status if
                   an error occurred during the expect rule evaluation.
                   "L7OKC", "L7RSP", "L7STS", "L6RSP" and "L4CON" are
                   supported :
                     - L7OKC : check conditionally passed on layer 7, set
                               server to NOLB state.
                     - L7RSP : layer 7 invalid response - protocol error
                     - L7STS : layer 7 response error, for example HTTP 5xx
                     - L6RSP : layer 6 invalid response - protocol error
                     - L4CON : layer 1-4 connection problem
                   By default "L7RSP" is used.

tout-status &lt;st&gt;   is optional and can be used to set the check status if
                   a timeout occurred during the expect rule evaluation.
                   "L7TOUT", "L6TOUT", and "L4TOUT" are supported :
                     - L7TOUT : layer 7 (HTTP/SMTP) timeout
                     - L6TOUT : layer 6 (SSL) timeout
                     - L4TOUT : layer 1-4 timeout
                   By default "L7TOUT" is used.

on-success &lt;fmt&gt;   is optional and can be used to customize the
                   informational message reported in logs if the expect
                   rule is successfully evaluated and if it is the last rule
                   in the tcp-check ruleset. &lt;fmt&gt; is a log-format string.

on-error &lt;fmt&gt;     is optional and can be used to customize the
                   informational message reported in logs if an error
                   occurred during the expect rule evaluation. &lt;fmt&gt; is a
                   log-format string.

status-code &lt;expr&gt; is optional and can be used to set the check status code
                   reported in logs, on success or on error. &lt;expr&gt; is a
                   standard HAProxy expression formed by a sample-fetch
                   followed by some converters.

&lt;pattern&gt; is the pattern to look for. It may be a string or a regular
          expression. If the pattern contains spaces, they must be escaped
          with the usual backslash ('\').
          If the match is set to binary, then the pattern must be passed as
          a series of hexadecimal digits in an even number. Each sequence of
          two digits will represent a byte. The hexadecimal digits may be
          used upper or lower case.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">The available matches are intentionally similar to their http-check cousins :

  string &lt;string&gt; : test the exact string matches in the response buffer.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's buffer contains this exact string. If the
                    "string" keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response
                    will be considered invalid if the body contains this
                    string. This can be used to look for a mandatory pattern
                    in a protocol response, or to detect a failure when a
                    specific error appears in a protocol banner.

  rstring &lt;regex&gt; : test a regular expression on the response buffer.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's buffer matches this expression. If the
                    "rstring" keyword is prefixed with "!", then the response
                    will be considered invalid if the body matches the
                    expression.

  string-lf &lt;fmt&gt; : test a log-format string match in the response's buffer.
                    A health check response will be considered valid if the
                    response's buffer contains the  string resulting of the
                    evaluation of &lt;fmt&gt;, which follows the log-format rules.
                    If prefixed with "!", then the response will be
                    considered invalid if the buffer contains the string.

  binary &lt;hexstring&gt; : test the exact string in its hexadecimal form matches
                       in the response buffer. A health check response will
                       be considered valid if the response's buffer contains
                       this exact hexadecimal string.
                       Purpose is to match data on binary protocols.

  rbinary &lt;regex&gt; : test a regular expression on the response buffer, like
                    "rstring". However, the response buffer is transformed
                    into its hexadecimal form, including NUL-bytes. This
                    allows using all regex engines to match any binary
                    content.  The hexadecimal transformation takes twice the
                    size of the original response. As such, the expected
                    pattern should work on at-most half the response buffer
                    size.

  binary-lf &lt;hexfmt&gt; : test a log-format string in its hexadecimal form
                       match in the response's buffer. A health check response
                       will be considered valid if the response's buffer
                       contains the hexadecimal string resulting of the
                       evaluation of &lt;fmt&gt;, which follows the log-format
                       rules. If prefixed with "!", then the response will be
                       considered invalid if the buffer contains the
                       hexadecimal string. The hexadecimal string is converted
                       in a binary string before matching the response's
                       buffer.

It is important to note that the responses will be limited to a certain size
defined by the global "<a href="#tune.bufsize">tune.bufsize</a>" option, which defaults to 16384 bytes.
Thus, too large responses may not contain the mandatory pattern when using
"string", "rstring" or binary. If a large response is absolutely required, it
is possible to change the default max size by setting the global variable.
However, it is worth keeping in mind that parsing very large responses can
waste some CPU cycles, especially when regular expressions are used, and that
it is always better to focus the checks on smaller resources. Also, in its
current state, the check will not find any string nor regex past a null
character in the response. Similarly it is not possible to request matching
the null character.

            below.

&lt;condition&gt; is a standard layer4-only ACL-based condition (see <a href="#7">section 7</a>).</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Immediately after acceptance of a new incoming connection, it is possible to
evaluate some conditions to decide whether this connection must be accepted
or dropped or have its counters tracked. Those conditions cannot make use of
any data contents because the connection has not been read from yet, and the
buffers are not yet allocated. This is used to selectively and very quickly
accept or drop connections from various sources with a very low overhead. If
some contents need to be inspected in order to take the decision, the
"<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" statements must be used instead.

The "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" rules are evaluated in their exact declaration
order. If no rule matches or if there is no rule, the default action is to
accept the incoming connection. There is no specific limit to the number of
rules which may be inserted.

Four types of actions are supported :
  - accept :
      accepts the connection if the condition is true (when used with "if")
      or false (when used with "unless"). The first such rule executed ends
      the rules evaluation.

  - reject :
      rejects the connection if the condition is true (when used with "if")
      or false (when used with "unless"). The first such rule executed ends
      the rules evaluation. Rejected connections do not even become a
      session, which is why they are accounted separately for in the stats,
      as "denied connections". They are not considered for the session
      rate-limit and are not logged either. The reason is that these rules
      should only be used to filter extremely high connection rates such as
      the ones encountered during a massive DDoS attack. Under these extreme
      conditions, the simple action of logging each event would make the
      system collapse and would considerably lower the filtering capacity. If
      logging is absolutely desired, then "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rules should
      be used instead, as "<a href="#tcp-request%20session">tcp-request session</a>" rules will not log either.

  - expect-proxy layer4 :
      configures the client-facing connection to receive a PROXY protocol
      header before any byte is read from the socket. This is equivalent to
      having the "<a href="#accept-proxy">accept-proxy</a>" keyword on the "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" line, except that using
      the TCP rule allows the PROXY protocol to be accepted only for certain
      IP address ranges using an ACL. This is convenient when multiple layers
      of load balancers are passed through by traffic coming from public
      hosts.

  - expect-netscaler-cip layer4 :
      configures the client-facing connection to receive a NetScaler Client
      IP insertion protocol header before any byte is read from the socket.
      This is equivalent to having the "<a href="#accept-netscaler-cip">accept-netscaler-cip</a>" keyword on the
      "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" line, except that using the TCP rule allows the PROXY protocol
      to be accepted only for certain IP address ranges using an ACL. This
      is convenient when multiple layers of load balancers are passed
      through by traffic coming from public hosts.

  - capture &lt;sample&gt; len &lt;length&gt; :
      This only applies to "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rules. It captures sample
      expression &lt;sample&gt; from the request buffer, and converts it to a
      string of at most &lt;len&gt; characters. The resulting string is stored into
      the next request "<a href="#capture">capture</a>" slot, so it will possibly appear next to
      some captured HTTP headers. It will then automatically appear in the
      logs, and it will be possible to extract it using sample fetch rules to
      feed it into headers or anything. The length should be limited given
      that this size will be allocated for each capture during the whole
      session life. Please check <a href="#7.3">section 7.3</a> (Fetching samples) and "capture
      request header" for more information.

  - { track-sc0 | track-sc1 | track-sc2 } &lt;key&gt; [table &lt;table&gt;] :
      enables tracking of sticky counters from current connection. These
      rules do not stop evaluation and do not change default action. The
      number of counters that may be simultaneously tracked by the same
      connection is set in MAX_SESS_STKCTR at build time (reported in
      haproxy -vv) which defaults to 3, so the track-sc number is between 0
      and (MAX_SESS_STKCTR-1). The first "track-sc0" rule executed enables
      tracking of the counters of the specified table as the first set. The
      first "track-sc1" rule executed enables tracking of the counters of the
      specified table as the second set. The first "track-sc2" rule executed
      enables tracking of the counters of the specified table as the third
      set. It is a recommended practice to use the first set of counters for
      the per-frontend counters and the second set for the per-backend ones.
      But this is just a guideline, all may be used everywhere.

      These actions take one or two arguments :
        &lt;key&gt;   is mandatory, and is a sample expression rule as described
                in <a href="#7.3">section 7.3</a>. It describes what elements of the incoming
                request or connection will be analyzed, extracted, combined,
                and used to select which table entry to update the counters.
                Note that "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" cannot use content-based
                fetches.

       &lt;table&gt;  is an optional table to be used instead of the default one,
                which is the stick-table declared in the current proxy. All
                the counters for the matches and updates for the key will
                then be performed in that table until the session ends.

      Once a "track-sc*" rule is executed, the key is looked up in the table
      and if it is not found, an entry is allocated for it. Then a pointer to
      that entry is kept during all the session's life, and this entry's
      counters are updated as often as possible, every time the session's
      counters are updated, and also systematically when the session ends.
      Counters are only updated for events that happen after the tracking has
      been started. For example, connection counters will not be updated when
      tracking layer 7 information, since the connection event happens before
      layer7 information is extracted.

      If the entry tracks concurrent connection counters, one connection is
      counted for as long as the entry is tracked, and the entry will not
      expire during that time. Tracking counters also provides a performance
      advantage over just checking the keys, because only one table lookup is
      performed for all ACL checks that make use of it.

  - sc-inc-gpc0(&lt;sc-id&gt;):
      The "sc-inc-gpc0" increments the GPC0 counter according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt;. If an error occurs, this action silently
      fails and the actions evaluation continues.

  - sc-inc-gpc1(&lt;sc-id&gt;):
      The "sc-inc-gpc1" increments the GPC1 counter according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt;. If an error occurs, this action silently
      fails and the actions evaluation continues.

  - sc-set-gpt0(&lt;sc-id&gt;) { &lt;int&gt; | &lt;expr&gt; }:
      This action sets the 32-bit unsigned GPT0 tag according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt; and the value of &lt;int&gt;/&lt;expr&gt;. The
      expected result is a boolean. If an error occurs, this action silently
      fails and the actions evaluation continues.

  - set-src &lt;expr&gt; :
    Is used to set the source IP address to the value of specified
    expression. Useful if you want to mask source IP for privacy.
    If you want to provide an IP from a HTTP header use "http-request
    set-src".

  - "silent-drop" :
      This stops the evaluation of the rules and makes the client-facing
      connection suddenly disappear using a system-dependent way that tries
      to prevent the client from being notified. The effect it then that the
      client still sees an established connection while there's none on
      HAProxy. The purpose is to achieve a comparable effect to "tarpit"
      except that it doesn't use any local resource at all on the machine
      running HAProxy. It can resist much higher loads than "tarpit", and
      slow down stronger attackers. It is important to understand the impact
      of using this mechanism. All stateful equipment placed between the
      client and HAProxy (firewalls, proxies, load balancers) will also keep
      the established connection for a long time and may suffer from this
      action. On modern Linux systems running with enough privileges, the
      TCP_REPAIR socket option is used to block the emission of a TCP
      reset. On other systems, the socket's TTL is reduced to 1 so that the
      TCP reset doesn't pass the first router, though it's still delivered to
      local networks. Do not use it unless you fully understand how it works.

Note that the "if/unless" condition is optional. If no condition is set on
the action, it is simply performed unconditionally. That can be useful for
"track-sc*" actions as well as for changing the default action to a reject.

            below.

&lt;condition&gt; is a standard layer 4-7 ACL-based condition (see <a href="#7">section 7</a>).</pre> </div> <pre class="text">A request's contents can be analyzed at an early stage of request processing
called "TCP content inspection". During this stage, ACL-based rules are
evaluated every time the request contents are updated, until either an
"accept", a "reject" or a "switch-mode" rule matches, or the TCP request
inspection delay expires with no matching rule.

The first difference between these rules and "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" rules
is that "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rules can make use of contents to take a
decision. Most often, these decisions will consider a protocol recognition or
validity. The second difference is that content-based rules can be used in
both frontends and backends. In case of HTTP keep-alive with the client, all
tcp-request content rules are evaluated again, so HAProxy keeps a record of
what sticky counters were assigned by a "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" versus a
"<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rule, and flushes all the content-related ones after
processing an HTTP request, so that they may be evaluated again by the rules
being evaluated again for the next request. This is of particular importance
when the rule tracks some L7 information or when it is conditioned by an
L7-based ACL, since tracking may change between requests.

Content-based rules are evaluated in their exact declaration order. If no
rule matches or if there is no rule, the default action is to accept the
contents. There is no specific limit to the number of rules which may be
inserted.

Several types of actions are supported :
  - accept : the request is accepted
  - do-resolve: perform a DNS resolution
  - reject : the request is rejected and the connection is closed
  - capture : the specified sample expression is captured
  - set-priority-class &lt;expr&gt; | set-priority-offset &lt;expr&gt;
  - { track-sc0 | track-sc1 | track-sc2 } &lt;key&gt; [table &lt;table&gt;]
  - sc-inc-gpc0(&lt;sc-id&gt;)
  - sc-inc-gpc1(&lt;sc-id&gt;)
  - sc-set-gpt0(&lt;sc-id&gt;) { &lt;int&gt; | &lt;expr&gt; }

  - silent-drop
  - send-spoe-group &lt;engine-name&gt; &lt;group-name&gt;
  - use-service &lt;service-name&gt;

They have the same meaning as their counter-parts in "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>"
so please refer to that section for a complete description.
For "do-resolve" action, please check the "<a href="#http-request%20do-resolve">http-request do-resolve</a>"
configuration section.

While there is nothing mandatory about it, it is recommended to use the
track-sc0 in "<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" rules, track-sc1 for "tcp-request
content" rules in the frontend, and track-sc2 for "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>"
rules in the backend, because that makes the configuration more readable
and easier to troubleshoot, but this is just a guideline and all counters
may be used everywhere.

Note that the "if/unless" condition is optional. If no condition is set on
the action, it is simply performed unconditionally. That can be useful for
"track-sc*" actions as well as for changing the default action to a reject.

Note also that it is recommended to use a "<a href="#tcp-request%20session">tcp-request session</a>" rule to track
information that does *not* depend on Layer 7 contents, especially for HTTP
frontends. Some HTTP processing are performed at the session level and may
lead to an early rejection of the requests. Thus, the tracking at the content
level may be disturbed in such case. A warning is emitted during startup to
prevent, as far as possible, such unreliable usage.

It is perfectly possible to match layer 7 contents with "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>"
rules from a TCP proxy, since HTTP-specific ACL matches are able to
preliminarily parse the contents of a buffer before extracting the required
data. If the buffered contents do not parse as a valid HTTP message, then the
ACL does not match.  The parser which is involved there is exactly the same
as for all other HTTP processing, so there is no risk of parsing something
differently. In an HTTP frontend or an HTTP backend, it is guaranteed that
HTTP contents will always be immediately present when the rule is evaluated
first because the HTTP parsing is performed in the early stages of the
connection processing, at the session level. But for such proxies, using
"<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" rules is much more natural and recommended.

Tracking layer7 information is also possible provided that the information
are present when the rule is processed. The rule processing engine is able to
wait until the inspect delay expires when the data to be tracked is not yet
available.

The "set-dst" and "set-dst-port" are used to set respectively the destination
IP and port. More information on how to use it at "<a href="#http-request%20set-dst">http-request set-dst</a>".

The "<span class="dropdown">set-var</span>" is used to set the content of a variable. The variable is
declared inline. For "<a href="#tcp-request%20session">tcp-request session</a>" rules, only session-level
variables can be used, without any layer7 contents.

  &lt;var-name&gt; The name of the variable starts with an indication about
             its scope. The scopes allowed are:
               "<a href="#proc">proc</a>" : the variable is shared with the whole process
               "sess" : the variable is shared with the whole session
               "txn"  : the variable is shared with the transaction
                        (request and response)
               "req"  : the variable is shared only during request
                        processing
               "res"  : the variable is shared only during response
                        processing
             This prefix is followed by a name. The separator is a '.'.
             The name may only contain characters 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9',
             '.' and '_'.

  &lt;expr&gt;     Is a standard HAProxy expression formed by a sample-fetch
             followed by some converters.

The "switch-mode" is used to perform a connection upgrade. Only HTTP
upgrades are supported for now. The protocol may optionally be
specified. This action is only available for a proxy with the frontend
capability. The connection upgrade is immediately performed, following
"<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rules are not evaluated. This upgrade method should be
preferred to the implicit one consisting to rely on the backend mode. When
used, it is possible to set HTTP directives in a frontend without any
warning. These directives will be conditionally evaluated if the HTTP upgrade
is performed. However, an HTTP backend must still be selected. It remains
unsupported to route an HTTP connection (upgraded or not) to a TCP server.

See <a href="#4">section 4</a> about Proxies for more details on HTTP upgrades.

The "<a href="#unset-var">unset-var</a>" is used to unset a variable. See above for details about
&lt;var-name&gt;.

The "set-priority-class" is used to set the queue priority class of the
current request. The value must be a sample expression which converts to an
integer in the range -2047..2047. Results outside this range will be
truncated. The priority class determines the order in which queued requests
are processed. Lower values have higher priority.

The "set-priority-offset" is used to set the queue priority timestamp offset
of the current request. The value must be a sample expression which converts
to an integer in the range -524287..524287. Results outside this range will be
truncated. When a request is queued, it is ordered first by the priority
class, then by the current timestamp adjusted by the given offset in
milliseconds. Lower values have higher priority.
Note that the resulting timestamp is is only tracked with enough precision for
524,287ms (8m44s287ms). If the request is queued long enough to where the
adjusted timestamp exceeds this value, it will be misidentified as highest
priority.  Thus it is important to set "<a href="#timeout%20queue">timeout queue</a>" to a value, where when
combined with the offset, does not exceed this limit.

The "send-spoe-group" is used to trigger sending of a group of SPOE
messages. To do so, the SPOE engine used to send messages must be defined, as
well as the SPOE group to send. Of course, the SPOE engine must refer to an
existing SPOE filter. If not engine name is provided on the SPOE filter line,
the SPOE agent name must be used.

  &lt;engine-name&gt; The SPOE engine name.

  &lt;group-name&gt;  The SPOE group name as specified in the engine configuration.

The "use-service" is used to executes a TCP service which will reply to the
request and stop the evaluation of the rules. This service may choose to
reply by sending any valid response or it may immediately close the
connection without sending anything. Outside natives services, it is possible
to write your own services in Lua. No further "<a href="#tcp-request">tcp-request</a>" rules are
evaluated.

risk of passing any type of protocol to a server without any analysis. In
order to be able to analyze the request contents, we must first withhold
the data then analyze them. This statement simply enables withholding of
data for at most the specified amount of time.

TCP content inspection applies very early when a connection reaches a
frontend, then very early when the connection is forwarded to a backend. This
means that a connection may experience a first delay in the frontend and a
second delay in the backend if both have tcp-request rules.

Note that when performing content inspection, HAProxy will evaluate the whole
rules for every new chunk which gets in, taking into account the fact that
those data are partial. If no rule matches before the aforementioned delay,
a last check is performed upon expiration, this time considering that the
contents are definitive. If no delay is set, HAProxy will not wait at all
and will immediately apply a verdict based on the available information.
Obviously this is unlikely to be very useful and might even be racy, so such
setups are not recommended.

As soon as a rule matches, the request is released and continues as usual. If
the timeout is reached and no rule matches, the default policy will be to let
it pass through unaffected.

For most protocols, it is enough to set it to a few seconds, as most clients
send the full request immediately upon connection. Add 3 or more seconds to
cover TCP retransmits but that's all. For some protocols, it may make sense
to use large values, for instance to ensure that the client never talks
before the server (e.g. SMTP), or to wait for a client to talk before passing
data to the server (e.g. SSL). Note that the client timeout must cover at
least the inspection delay, otherwise it will expire first. If the client
closes the connection or if the buffer is full, the delay immediately expires
since the contents will not be able to change anymore.

            below.

&lt;condition&gt; is a standard layer 4-7 ACL-based condition (see <a href="#7">section 7</a>).</pre> </div> <pre class="text">Response contents can be analyzed at an early stage of response processing
called "TCP content inspection". During this stage, ACL-based rules are
evaluated every time the response contents are updated, until either an
"accept", "close" or a "reject" rule matches, or a TCP response inspection
delay is set and expires with no matching rule.

Most often, these decisions will consider a protocol recognition or validity.

Content-based rules are evaluated in their exact declaration order. If no
rule matches or if there is no rule, the default action is to accept the
contents. There is no specific limit to the number of rules which may be
inserted.

Several types of actions are supported :
  - accept :
      accepts the response if the condition is true (when used with "if")
      or false (when used with "unless"). The first such rule executed ends
      the rules evaluation.

  - close :
      immediately closes the connection with the server if the condition is
      true (when used with "if"), or false (when used with "unless"). The
      first such rule executed ends the rules evaluation. The main purpose of
      this action is to force a connection to be finished between a client
      and a server after an exchange when the application protocol expects
      some long time outs to elapse first. The goal is to eliminate idle
      connections which take significant resources on servers with certain
      protocols.

  - reject :
      rejects the response if the condition is true (when used with "if")
      or false (when used with "unless"). The first such rule executed ends
      the rules evaluation. Rejected session are immediately closed.

  - set-var(&lt;var-name&gt;) &lt;expr&gt;
      Sets a variable.

  - unset-var(&lt;var-name&gt;)
      Unsets a variable.

  - sc-inc-gpc0(&lt;sc-id&gt;):
      This action increments the GPC0 counter according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt;. If an error occurs, this action fails
      silently and the actions evaluation continues.

  - sc-inc-gpc1(&lt;sc-id&gt;):
      This action increments the GPC1 counter according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt;. If an error occurs, this action fails
      silently and the actions evaluation continues.

  - sc-set-gpt0(&lt;sc-id&gt;) { &lt;int&gt; | &lt;expr&gt; }
      This action sets the 32-bit unsigned GPT0 tag according to the sticky
      counter designated by &lt;sc-id&gt; and the value of &lt;int&gt;/&lt;expr&gt;. The
      expected result is a boolean. If an error occurs, this action silently
      fails and the actions evaluation continues.

  - "silent-drop" :
      This stops the evaluation of the rules and makes the client-facing
      connection suddenly disappear using a system-dependent way that tries
      to prevent the client from being notified. The effect it then that the
      client still sees an established connection while there's none on
      HAProxy. The purpose is to achieve a comparable effect to "tarpit"
      except that it doesn't use any local resource at all on the machine
      running HAProxy. It can resist much higher loads than "tarpit", and
      slow down stronger attackers. It is important to understand the impact
      of using this mechanism. All stateful equipment placed between the
      client and HAProxy (firewalls, proxies, load balancers) will also keep
      the established connection for a long time and may suffer from this
      action. On modern Linux systems running with enough privileges, the
      TCP_REPAIR socket option is used to block the emission of a TCP
      reset. On other systems, the socket's TTL is reduced to 1 so that the
      TCP reset doesn't pass the first router, though it's still delivered to
      local networks. Do not use it unless you fully understand how it works.

  - send-spoe-group &lt;engine-name&gt; &lt;group-name&gt;
      Send a group of SPOE messages.

Note that the "if/unless" condition is optional. If no condition is set on
the action, it is simply performed unconditionally. That can be useful for
for changing the default action to a reject.

It is perfectly possible to match layer 7 contents with "tcp-response
content" rules, but then it is important to ensure that a full response has
been buffered, otherwise no contents will match. In order to achieve this,
the best solution involves detecting the HTTP protocol during the inspection
period.

The "<span class="dropdown">set-var</span>" is used to set the content of a variable. The variable is
declared inline.

  &lt;var-name&gt; The name of the variable starts with an indication about
             its scope. The scopes allowed are:
               "<a href="#proc">proc</a>" : the variable is shared with the whole process
               "sess" : the variable is shared with the whole session
               "txn"  : the variable is shared with the transaction
                        (request and response)
               "req"  : the variable is shared only during request
                        processing
               "res"  : the variable is shared only during response
                        processing
             This prefix is followed by a name. The separator is a '.'.
             The name may only contain characters 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9',

it is possible to evaluate some conditions to decide whether this session
must be accepted or dropped or have its counters tracked. Those conditions
cannot make use of any data contents because no buffers are allocated yet and
the processing cannot wait at this stage. The main use case it to copy some
early information into variables (since variables are accessible in the
session), or to keep track of some information collected after the handshake,
such as SSL-level elements (SNI, ciphers, client cert's CN) or information
from the PROXY protocol header (e.g. track a source forwarded this way). The
extracted information can thus be copied to a variable or tracked using
"track-sc" rules. Of course it is also possible to decide to accept/reject as
with other rulesets. Most operations performed here could also be performed
in "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" rules, except that in HTTP these rules are evaluated
for each new request, and that might not always be acceptable. For example a
rule might increment a counter on each evaluation. It would also be possible
that a country is resolved by geolocation from the source IP address,
assigned to a session-wide variable, then the source address rewritten from
an HTTP header for all requests. If some contents need to be inspected in
order to take the decision, the "<a href="#tcp-request%20content">tcp-request content</a>" statements must be used
instead.

The "<a href="#tcp-request%20session">tcp-request session</a>" rules are evaluated in their exact declaration
order. If no rule matches or if there is no rule, the default action is to
accept the incoming session. There is no specific limit to the number of
rules which may be inserted.

Several types of actions are supported :
  - accept : the request is accepted
  - reject : the request is rejected and the connection is closed
  - { track-sc0 | track-sc1 | track-sc2 } &lt;key&gt; [table &lt;table&gt;]

by "<a href="#timeout%20http-request">timeout http-request</a>". However this is not always convenient because some
people want very short keep-alive timeouts in order to release connections
faster, and others prefer to have larger ones but still have short timeouts
once the request has started to present itself.

The "<a href="#option%20http-keep-alive">http-keep-alive</a>" timeout covers these needs. It will define how long to
wait for a new HTTP request to start coming after a response was sent. Once
the first byte of request has been seen, the "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" timeout is used
to wait for the complete request to come. Note that empty lines prior to a
new request do not refresh the timeout and are not counted as a new request.

There is also another difference between the two timeouts : when a connection
expires during timeout http-keep-alive, no error is returned, the connection
just closes. If the connection expires in "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" while waiting for a
connection to complete, a HTTP 408 error is returned.

In general it is optimal to set this value to a few tens to hundreds of
milliseconds, to allow users to fetch all objects of a page at once but
without waiting for further clicks. Also, if set to a very small value (e.g.
1 millisecond) it will probably only accept pipelined requests but not the
non-pipelined ones. It may be a nice trade-off for very large sites running
with tens to hundreds of thousands of clients.

If this parameter is not set, the "<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" timeout applies, and if both
are not set, "<span class="dropdown">timeout client</span>" still applies at the lower level. It should be
set in the frontend to take effect, unless the frontend is in TCP mode, in
which case the HTTP backend's timeout will be used.

When using HTTP/2 "<span class="dropdown">timeout client</span>" is applied instead. This is so we can keep
using short keep-alive timeouts in HTTP/1.1 while using longer ones in HTTP/2
(where we only have one connection per client and a connection setup).

accepted time to receive a complete HTTP request without affecting the client
timeout. This helps protecting against established connections on which
nothing is sent. The client timeout cannot offer a good protection against
this abuse because it is an inactivity timeout, which means that if the
attacker sends one character every now and then, the timeout will not
trigger. With the HTTP request timeout, no matter what speed the client
types, the request will be aborted if it does not complete in time. When the
timeout expires, an HTTP 408 response is sent to the client to inform it
about the problem, and the connection is closed. The logs will report
termination codes "cR". Some recent browsers are having problems with this
standard, well-documented behavior, so it might be needed to hide the 408
code using "<a href="#option%20http-ignore-probes">option http-ignore-probes</a>" or "errorfile 408 /dev/null". See
more details in the explanations of the "cR" termination code in <a href="#8.5">section 8.5</a>.

By default, this timeout only applies to the header part of the request,
and not to any data. As soon as the empty line is received, this timeout is
not used anymore. When combined with "<a href="#option%20http-buffer-request">option http-buffer-request</a>", this
timeout also applies to the body of the request..
It is used again on keep-alive connections to wait for a second
request if "<a href="#timeout%20http-keep-alive">timeout http-keep-alive</a>" is not set.

Generally it is enough to set it to a few seconds, as most clients send the
full request immediately upon connection. Add 3 or more seconds to cover TCP
retransmits but that's all. Setting it to very low values (e.g. 50 ms) will
generally work on local networks as long as there are no packet losses. This
will prevent people from sending bare HTTP requests using telnet.

If this parameter is not set, the client timeout still applies between each
chunk of the incoming request. It should be set in the frontend to take
effect, unless the frontend is in TCP mode, in which case the HTTP backend's
timeout will be used.

directions. This timeout supersedes both the client and server timeouts once
the connection becomes a tunnel. In TCP, this timeout is used as soon as no
analyzer remains attached to either connection (e.g. tcp content rules are
accepted). In HTTP, this timeout is used when a connection is upgraded (e.g.
when switching to the WebSocket protocol, or forwarding a CONNECT request
to a proxy), or after the first response when no keepalive/close option is
specified.

Since this timeout is usually used in conjunction with long-lived connections,
it usually is a good idea to also set "<a href="#timeout%20client-fin">timeout client-fin</a>" to handle the
situation where a client suddenly disappears from the net and does not

%ID tag the log-format string.

The format should be composed from elements that are guaranteed to be
unique when combined together. For instance, if multiple HAProxy instances
are involved, it might be important to include the node name. It is often
needed to log the incoming connection's source and destination addresses
and ports. Note that since multiple requests may be performed over the same
connection, including a request counter may help differentiate them.
Similarly, a timestamp may protect against a rollover of the counter.
Logging the process ID will avoid collisions after a service restart.

It is recommended to use hexadecimal notation for many fields since it
makes them more compact and saves space in logs.

            it is omitted, the rule is unconditionally applied.</pre> </div> <pre class="text">When doing content-switching, connections arrive on a frontend and are then
dispatched to various backends depending on a number of conditions. The
relation between the conditions and the backends is described with the
"<a href="#use_backend">use_backend</a>" keyword. While it is normally used with HTTP processing, it can
also be used in pure TCP, either without content using stateless ACLs (e.g.
source address validation) or combined with a "<a href="#tcp-request">tcp-request</a>" rule to wait for
some payload.

There may be as many "<a href="#use_backend">use_backend</a>" rules as desired. All of these rules are
evaluated in their declaration order, and the first one which matches will
assign the backend.

In the first form, the backend will be used if the condition is met. In the
second form, the backend will be used if the condition is not met. If no
condition is valid, the backend defined with "<a href="#default_backend">default_backend</a>" will be used.
If no default backend is defined, either the servers in the same section are
used (in case of a "listen" section) or, in case of a frontend, no server is
used and a 503 service unavailable response is returned.

Note that it is possible to switch from a TCP frontend to an HTTP backend. In
this case, either the frontend has already checked that the protocol is HTTP,
and backend processing will immediately follow, or the backend will wait for
a complete HTTP request to get in. This feature is useful when a frontend
must decode several protocols on a unique port, one of them being HTTP.

When &lt;backend&gt; is a simple name, it is resolved at configuration time, and an
error is reported if the specified backend does not exist. If &lt;backend&gt; is
a log-format string instead, no check may be done at configuration time, so
the backend name is resolved dynamically at run time. If the resulting
backend name does not correspond to any valid backend, no other rule is
evaluated, and the default_backend directive is applied instead. Note that
when using dynamic backend names, it is highly recommended to use a prefix
that no other backend uses in order to ensure that an unauthorized backend
cannot be forced from the request.

It is worth mentioning that "<a href="#use_backend">use_backend</a>" rules with an explicit name are
used to detect the association between frontends and backends to compute the
backend's "<a href="#fullconn">fullconn</a>" setting. This cannot be done for dynamic names.

the available servers according to the configured algorithm, unless a
persistence mechanism such as a cookie is used and found in the request.

Sometimes it is desirable to forward a particular request to a specific
server without having to declare a dedicated backend for this server. This
can be achieved using the "<a href="#use-server">use-server</a>" rules. These rules are evaluated after
the "<a href="#redirect">redirect</a>" rules and before evaluating cookies, and they have precedence
on them. There may be as many "<a href="#use-server">use-server</a>" rules as desired. All of these
rules are evaluated in their declaration order, and the first one which
matches will assign the server.

If a rule designates a server which is down, and "<a href="#option%20persist">option persist</a>" is not used
and no force-persist rule was validated, it is ignored and evaluation goes on
with the next rules until one matches.

In the first form, the server will be used if the condition is met. In the
second form, the server will be used if the condition is not met. If no
condition is valid, the processing continues and the server will be assigned
according to other persistence mechanisms.

Note that even if a rule is matched, cookie processing is still performed but
does not assign the server. This allows prefixed cookies to have their prefix
stripped.

The "<a href="#use-server">use-server</a>" statement works both in HTTP and TCP mode. This makes it
suitable for use with content-based inspection. For instance, a server could
be selected in a farm according to the TLS SNI field when using protocols with
implicit TLS (also see "<a href="#req_ssl_sni">req_ssl_sni</a>"). And if these servers have their weight
set to zero, they will not be used for other traffic.

<div class="keyword" id="crt">
<b>crt</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;cert&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">This setting is only available when support for OpenSSL was built in. It
designates a PEM file containing both the required certificates and any
associated private keys. This file can be built by concatenating multiple
PEM files into one (e.g. cat cert.pem key.pem &gt; combined.pem). If your CA
requires an intermediate certificate, this can also be concatenated into this
file. Intermediate certificate can also be shared in a directory via
"<a href="#issuers-chain-path">issuers-chain-path</a>" directive.

If the file does not contain a private key, HAProxy will try to load
the key at the same path suffixed by a ".key".

If the OpenSSL used supports Diffie-Hellman, parameters present in this file
are loaded.

If a directory name is used instead of a PEM file, then all files found in
that directory will be loaded in alphabetic order unless their name ends
with '.key', '.issuer', '.ocsp' or '.sctl' (reserved extensions). This
directive may be specified multiple times in order to load certificates from
multiple files or directories. The certificates will be presented to clients
who provide a valid TLS Server Name Indication field matching one of their
CN or alt subjects. Wildcards are supported, where a wildcard character '*'
is used instead of the first hostname component (e.g. *.example.org matches
www.example.org but not www.sub.example.org).

If no SNI is provided by the client or if the SSL library does not support
TLS extensions, or if the client provides an SNI hostname which does not
match any certificate, then the first loaded certificate will be presented.
This means that when loading certificates from a directory, it is highly
recommended to load the default one first as a file or to ensure that it will
always be the first one in the directory.

Note that the same cert may be loaded multiple times without side effects.

Some CAs (such as GoDaddy) offer a drop down list of server types that do not
include HAProxy when obtaining a certificate. If this happens be sure to
choose a web server that the CA believes requires an intermediate CA (for
GoDaddy, selection Apache Tomcat will get the correct bundle, but many
others, e.g. nginx, result in a wrong bundle that will not work for some
clients).

For each PEM file, HAProxy checks for the presence of file at the same path
suffixed by ".ocsp". If such file is found, support for the TLS Certificate
Status Request extension (also known as "OCSP stapling") is automatically
enabled. The content of this file is optional. If not empty, it must contain
a valid OCSP Response in DER format. In order to be valid an OCSP Response
must comply with the following rules: it has to indicate a good status,
it has to be a single response for the certificate of the PEM file, and it
has to be valid at the moment of addition. If these rules are not respected
the OCSP Response is ignored and a warning is emitted. In order to  identify
which certificate an OCSP Response applies to, the issuer's certificate is
necessary. If the issuer's certificate is not found in the PEM file, it will
be loaded from a file at the same path as the PEM file suffixed by ".issuer"
if it exists otherwise it will fail with an error.

For each PEM file, HAProxy also checks for the presence of file at the same
path suffixed by ".sctl". If such file is found, support for Certificate
Transparency (RFC6962) TLS extension is enabled. The file must contain a
valid Signed Certificate Timestamp List, as described in RFC. File is parsed
to check basic syntax, but no signatures are verified.

There are cases where it is desirable to support multiple key types, e.g. RSA
and ECDSA in the cipher suites offered to the clients. This allows clients
that support EC certificates to be able to use EC ciphers, while
simultaneously supporting older, RSA only clients.

To achieve this, OpenSSL 1.1.1 is required, you can configure this behavior
by providing one crt entry per certificate type, or by configuring a "cert
bundle" like it was required before HAProxy 1.8. See "<a href="#ssl-load-extra-files">ssl-load-extra-files</a>".

configuration set in bind line for the certificate.

Wildcards are supported in the SNI filter. Negative filter are also supported,
useful in combination with a wildcard filter to exclude a particular SNI, or
after the first certificate to exclude a pattern from its CN or Subject Alt
Name (SAN). The certificates will be presented to clients who provide a valid
TLS Server Name Indication field matching one of the SNI filters. If no SNI
filter is specified, the CN and SAN are used. This directive may be specified

The first declared certificate of a bind line is used as the default
certificate, either from crt or crt-list option, which HAProxy should use in
the TLS handshake if no other certificate matches. This certificate will also
be used if the provided SNI matches its CN or SAN, even if a matching SNI
filter is found on any crt-list. The SNI filter !* can be used after the first
declared certificate to not include its CN and SAN in the SNI tree, so it will
never match except if no other certificate matches. This way the first
declared certificate act as a fallback.

crt-list file example:
      cert1.pem !*
      # comment
      cert2.pem [alpn h2,http/1.1]
      certW.pem                   *.domain.tld !secure.domain.tld

<div class="keyword" id="defer-accept"><b>defer-accept</b></div>
<pre class="text">Is an optional keyword which is supported only on certain Linux kernels. It
states that a connection will only be accepted once some data arrive on it,
or at worst after the first retransmit. This should be used only on protocols
for which the client talks first (e.g. HTTP). It can slightly improve
performance by ensuring that most of the request is already available when
the connection is accepted. On the other hand, it will not be able to detect
connections which don't talk. It is important to note that this option is
broken in all kernels up to 2.6.31, as the connection is never accepted until
the client talks. This can cause issues with front firewalls which would see
an established connection while the proxy will only see it in SYN_RECV. This
option is only supported on TCPv4/TCPv6 sockets and ignored by other ones.

<div class="keyword" id="generate-certificates"><b>generate-certificates</b></div>
<pre class="text">This setting is only available when support for OpenSSL was built in. It
enables the dynamic SSL certificates generation. A CA certificate and its
private key are necessary (see 'ca-sign-file'). When HAProxy is configured as
a transparent forward proxy, SSL requests generate errors because of a common
name mismatch on the certificate presented to the client. With this option
enabled, HAProxy will try to forge a certificate using the SNI hostname
indicated by the client. This is done only if no certificate matches the SNI
hostname (see 'crt-list'). If an error occurs, the default certificate is
used, else the 'strict-sni' option is set.
It can also be used when HAProxy is configured as a reverse proxy to ease the
deployment of an architecture with many backends.

Creating a SSL certificate is an expensive operation, so a LRU cache is used
to store forged certificates (see 'tune.ssl.ssl-ctx-cache-size'). It
increases the HAProxy's memory footprint to reduce latency when the same
certificate is used many times.

<pre class="text">Restricts the socket to a specific interface. When specified, only packets
received from that particular interface are processed by the socket. This is
currently only supported on Linux. The interface must be a primary system
interface, not an aliased interface. It is also possible to bind multiple
frontends to the same address if they are bound to different interfaces. Note
that binding to a network interface requires root privileges. This parameter
is only compatible with TCPv4/TCPv6 sockets. When specified, return traffic
uses the same interface as inbound traffic, and its associated routing table,
even if there are explicit routes through different interfaces configured.
This can prove useful to address asymmetric routing issues when the same

</div>
<pre class="text">Sets the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) value to be advertised on incoming

ports, for instance for connections passing through a VPN. Note that this
relies on a kernel feature which is theoretically supported under Linux but
was buggy in all versions prior to 2.6.28. It may or may not work on other
operating systems. It may also not change the advertised value but change the
effective size of outgoing segments. The commonly advertised value for TCPv4
over Ethernet networks is 1460 = 1500(MTU) - 40(IP+TCP). If this value is
positive, it will be used as the advertised MSS. If it is negative, it will
indicate by how much to reduce the incoming connection's advertised MSS for

<div class="keyword" id="nice">
<b>nice</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;nice&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">Sets the 'niceness' of connections initiated from the socket. Value must be
in the range -1024..1024 inclusive, and defaults to zero. Positive values
means that such connections are more friendly to others and easily offer
their place in the scheduler. On the opposite, negative values mean that
connections want to run with a higher priority than others. The difference
only happens under high loads when the system is close to saturation.
Negative values are appropriate for low-latency or administration services,
and high values are generally recommended for CPU intensive tasks such as SSL
processing or bulk transfers which are less sensible to latency. For example,
it may make sense to use a positive value for an SMTP socket and a negative
one for an RDP socket.

on any remaining process, a warning is emitted, and the listener will either
run on the first process of the listener if a single process was specified,
or on all of its processes if multiple processes were specified. If a thread
set is specified, it limits the threads allowed to process incoming
connections for this listener, for the the process set. If multiple processes

Ranges can be partially defined. The higher bound can be omitted. In such

this directive is to be used with the stats sockets and have one different
socket per process. The second purpose is to have multiple bind lines sharing
the same IP:port but not the same process in a listener, so that the system
can distribute the incoming connections into multiple queues and allow a
smoother inter-process load balancing. Currently Linux 3.9 and above is known

the side (FE/BE), the mux name and its flags.

Some protocols report errors on aborts (flag=CLEAN_ABRT). Some others are
subject to the head-of-line blocking on server side (flag=HOL_RISK). Finally
some protocols don't support upgrades (flag=NO_UPG). The HTX compatibility is
also reported (flag=HTX).

Here are the protocols that may be used as argument to a "<span class="dropdown">proto</span>" directive on
a bind line :

  h1   : mode=HTTP  side=FE|BE  mux=H1    flags=HTX|NO_UPG
  none : mode=TCP   side=FE|BE  mux=PASS  flags=NO_UPG

Idea behind this option is to bypass the selection of the best multiplexer's

useful on long-lived connections experiencing long idle periods such as
remote terminals or database connection pools, where the client and server
timeouts must remain high to allow a long period of idle, but where it is
important to detect that the client has disappeared in order to release all

round-trip after the first connection. This only makes sense with protocols
that use high connection rates and where each round trip matters. This can
possibly cause issues with many firewalls which do not accept data on SYN
packets, so this option should only be enabled once well tested. This option

The first key determines the key length used for next keys: you can't mix
aes128 and aes256 keys. Number of keys is specified by the TLS_TICKETS_NO
build option (default 3) and at least as many keys need to be present in
the file. Last TLS_TICKETS_NO keys will be used for decryption and the
penultimate one for encryption. This enables easy key rotation by just
appending new key to the file and reloading the process.  Keys must be
periodically rotated (ex. every 12h) or Perfect Forward Secrecy is
compromised. It is also a good idea to keep the keys off any permanent
storage such as hard drives (hint: use tmpfs and don't swap those files).
Lifetime hint can be changed using tune.ssl.timeout.

which are all passed as arguments on the server line. The order in which those
arguments appear does not count, and they are all optional. Some of those

after them. In this case, the values must immediately follow the setting name.
Except default-server, all those settings must be specified after the server's

Note that all these settings are supported both by "<span class="dropdown">server</span>" and "<span class="dropdown">default-server</span>"

The currently supported settings are the following ones.
</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="addr">
<b>addr</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;ipv4|ipv6&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">Using the "<a href="#addr">addr</a>" parameter, it becomes possible to use a different IP address
to send health-checks or to probe the agent-check. On some servers, it may be
desirable to dedicate an IP address to specific component able to perform
complex tests which are more suitable to health-checks than the application.
This parameter is ignored if the "<a href="#check">check</a>" parameter is not set. See also the
"<a href="#port">port</a>" parameter.
</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="agent-check"><b>agent-check</b></div>
<pre class="text">Enable an auxiliary agent check which is run independently of a regular
health check. An agent health check is performed by making a TCP connection
to the port set by the "<a href="#agent-port">agent-port</a>" parameter and reading an ASCII string
terminated by the first '\r' or '\n' met. The string is made of a series of
words delimited by spaces, tabs or commas in any order, each consisting of :

- An ASCII representation of a positive integer percentage, e.g. "75%".
  Values in this format will set the weight proportional to the initial
  weight of a server as configured when HAProxy starts. Note that a zero
  weight is reported on the stats page as "DRAIN" since it has the same
  effect on the server (it's removed from the LB farm).

- The string "maxconn:" followed by an integer (no space between). Values
  in this format will set the maxconn of a server. The maximum number of
  connections advertised needs to be multiplied by the number of load
  balancers and different backends that use this health check to get the
  total number of connections the server might receive. Example: maxconn:30

- The word "ready". This will turn the server's administrative state to the
  READY mode, thus canceling any DRAIN or MAINT state

- The word "drain". This will turn the server's administrative state to the
  DRAIN mode, thus it will not accept any new connections other than those
  that are accepted via persistence.

- The word "maint". This will turn the server's administrative state to the
  MAINT mode, thus it will not accept any new connections at all, and health
  checks will be stopped.

- The words "down", "fail", or "stopped", optionally followed by a
  description string after a sharp ('#'). All of these mark the server's
  operating state as DOWN, but since the word itself is reported on the stats
  page, the difference allows an administrator to know if the situation was
  expected or not : the service may intentionally be stopped, may appear up
  but fail some validity tests, or may be seen as down (e.g. missing process,
  or port not responding).

- The word "up" sets back the server's operating state as UP if health checks
  also report that the service is accessible.

Parameters which are not advertised by the agent are not changed. For
example, an agent might be designed to monitor CPU usage and only report a
relative weight and never interact with the operating status. Similarly, an
agent could be designed as an end-user interface with 3 radio buttons
allowing an administrator to change only the administrative state. However,
it is important to consider that only the agent may revert its own actions,
so if a server is set to DRAIN mode or to DOWN state using the agent, the
agent must implement the other equivalent actions to bring the service into
operations again.

Failure to connect to the agent is not considered an error as connectivity
is tested by the regular health check which is enabled by the "<a href="#check">check</a>"
parameter. Warning though, it is not a good idea to stop an agent after it
reports "down", since only an agent reporting "up" will be able to turn the
server up again. Note that the CLI on the Unix stats socket is also able to
force an agent's result in order to work around a bogus agent if needed.

Requires the "<a href="#agent-port">agent-port</a>" parameter to be set. See also the "<a href="#agent-inter">agent-inter</a>"
and "<a href="#no-agent-check">no-agent-check</a>" parameters.

</div>
<pre class="text">If this option is specified, HAProxy will send the given string (verbatim)
to the agent server upon connection. You could, for example, encode
the backend name into this string, which would enable your agent to send

you want to terminate your request with a newline.

<pre class="text">The "<a href="#agent-inter">agent-inter</a>" parameter sets the interval between two agent checks
to &lt;delay&gt; milliseconds. If left unspecified, the delay defaults to 2000 ms.

Just as with every other time-based parameter, it may be entered in any
other explicit unit among { us, ms, s, m, h, d }. The "<a href="#agent-inter">agent-inter</a>"
parameter also serves as a timeout for agent checks "<a href="#timeout%20check">timeout check</a>" is
not set. In order to reduce "resonance" effects when multiple servers are
hosted on the same hardware, the agent and health checks of all servers
are started with a small time offset between them. It is also possible to
add some random noise in the agent and health checks interval using the
global "<a href="#spread-checks">spread-checks</a>" keyword. This makes sense for instance when a lot
of backends use the same servers.

<div class="keyword" id="check"><b>check</b></div>
<pre class="text">This option enables health checks on a server:
  - when not set, no health checking is performed, and the server is always
    considered available.
  - when set and no other check method is configured, the server is considered
    available when a connection can be established at the highest configured
    transport layer. This means TCP by default, or SSL/TLS when "<span class="dropdown">ssl</span>" or
    "<a href="#check-ssl">check-ssl</a>" are set, both possibly combined with connection prefixes such
    as a PROXY protocol header when "<a href="#send-proxy">send-proxy</a>" or "<a href="#check-send-proxy">check-send-proxy</a>" are
    set.
  - when set and an application-level health check is defined, the
    application-level exchanges are performed on top of the configured
    transport layer and the server is considered available if all of the
    exchanges succeed.

By default, health checks are performed on the same address and port as
configured on the server, using the same encapsulation parameters (SSL/TLS,
proxy-protocol header, etc... ). It is possible to change the destination
address using "<a href="#addr">addr</a>" and the port using "<a href="#port">port</a>". When done, it is assumed the
server isn't checked on the service port, and configured encapsulation
parameters are not reused. One must explicitly set "<a href="#check-send-proxy">check-send-proxy</a>" to send
connection headers, "<a href="#check-ssl">check-ssl</a>" to use SSL/TLS.

When "<a href="#sni">sni</a>" or "<span class="dropdown">alpn</span>" are set on the server line, their value is not used for
health checks and one must use "<a href="#check-sni">check-sni</a>" or "<a href="#check-alpn">check-alpn</a>".

The default source address for health check traffic is the same as the one
defined in the backend. It can be changed with the "<span class="dropdown">source</span>" keyword.

The interval between checks can be set using the "<a href="#inter">inter</a>" keyword, and the
"<a href="#rise">rise</a>" and "<a href="#fall">fall</a>" keywords can be used to define how many successful or
failed health checks are required to flag a server available or not
available.

Optional application-level health checks can be configured with "option

HTTP). It must also be usable on the backend side. The list of available
protocols is reported in haproxy -vv. The protocols properties are
reported : the mode (TCP/HTTP), the side (FE/BE), the mux name and its flags.

Some protocols report errors on aborts (flag=CLEAN_ABRT). Some others are
subject to the head-of-line blocking on server side (flag=HOL_RISK). Finally
some protocols don't support upgrades (flag=NO_UPG). The HTX compatibility is
also reported (flag=HTX).

Here are the protocols that may be used as argument to a "<a href="#check-proto">check-proto</a>"
directive on a server line:

  h2   : mode=HTTP  side=FE|BE  mux=H2    flags=HTX|CLEAN_ABRT|HOL_RISK|NO_UPG
  fcgi : mode=HTTP  side=BE     mux=FCGI  flags=HTX|HOL_RISK|NO_UPG
  h1   : mode=HTTP  side=FE|BE  mux=H1    flags=HTX|NO_UPG
  none : mode=TCP   side=FE|BE  mux=PASS  flags=NO_UPG

Idea behind this option is to bypass the selection of the best multiplexer's
protocol for health-check connections established to this server.
If not defined, the server one will be used, if set.

checks are not inherited. It is important to understand that this option
inserts an SSL transport layer below the checks, so that a simple TCP connect
check becomes an SSL connect, which replaces the old ssl-hello-chk. The most
common use is to send HTTPS checks by combining "<a href="#option%20httpchk">httpchk</a>" with SSL checks.

<pre class="text">Just as with every other time-based parameter, they can be entered in any
other explicit unit among { us, ms, s, m, h, d }. The "<a href="#inter">inter</a>" parameter also
serves as a timeout for health checks sent to servers if "<a href="#timeout%20check">timeout check</a>" is
not set. In order to reduce "resonance" effects when multiple servers are
hosted on the same hardware, the agent and health checks of all servers
are started with a small time offset between them. It is also possible to
add some random noise in the agent and health checks interval using the
global "<a href="#spread-checks">spread-checks</a>" keyword. This makes sense for instance when a lot
of backends use the same servers.

<div class="keyword" id="log-proto">
<b>log-proto</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;logproto&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">The "<a href="#log-proto">log-proto</a>" specifies the protocol used to forward event messages to
a server configured in a ring section. Possible values are "legacy"
and "octet-count" corresponding respectively to "Non-transparent-framing"

</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="maxconn">
<b>maxconn</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;maxconn&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">The "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter specifies the maximal number of concurrent
connections that will be sent to this server. If the number of incoming
concurrent connections goes higher than this value, they will be queued,
waiting for a slot to be released. This parameter is very important as it can
save fragile servers from going down under extreme loads. If a "<a href="#minconn">minconn</a>"
parameter is specified, the limit becomes dynamic. The default value is "0"
which means unlimited. See also the "<a href="#minconn">minconn</a>" and "<a href="#maxqueue">maxqueue</a>" parameters, and
the backend's "<a href="#fullconn">fullconn</a>" keyword.

In HTTP mode this parameter limits the number of concurrent requests instead
of the number of connections. Multiple requests might be multiplexed over a
single TCP connection to the server. As an example if you specify a maxconn
of 50 you might see between 1 and 50 actual server connections, but no more
than 50 concurrent requests.
</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="maxqueue">
<b>maxqueue</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;maxqueue&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">The "<a href="#maxqueue">maxqueue</a>" parameter specifies the maximal number of connections which
will wait in the queue for this server. If this limit is reached, next
requests will be redispatched to other servers instead of indefinitely
waiting to be served. This will break persistence but may allow people to
quickly re-log in when the server they try to connect to is dying. Some load
balancing algorithms such as leastconn take this into account and accept to
add requests into a server's queue up to this value if it is explicitly set
to a value greater than zero, which often allows to better smooth the load
when dealing with single-digit maxconn values. The default value is "0" which
means the queue is unlimited. See also the "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" and "<a href="#minconn">minconn</a>" parameters
and "balance leastconn".

<pre class="text">The "<a href="#max-reuse">max-reuse</a>" argument indicates the HTTP connection processors that they
should not reuse a server connection more than this number of times to send
new requests. Permitted values are -1 (the default), which disables this
limit, or any positive value. Value zero will effectively disable keep-alive.
This is only used to work around certain server bugs which cause them to leak
resources over time. The argument is not necessarily respected by the lower
layers as there might be technical limitations making it impossible to
enforce. At least HTTP/2 connections to servers will respect it.
</pre>
<div class="keyword" id="minconn">
<b>minconn</b> <span style="color: #080">&lt;minconn&gt;</span>
</div>
<pre class="text">When the "<a href="#minconn">minconn</a>" parameter is set, the maxconn limit becomes a dynamic
limit following the backend's load. The server will always accept at least
&lt;minconn&gt; connections, never more than &lt;maxconn&gt;, and the limit will be on
the ramp between both values when the backend has less than &lt;fullconn&gt;
concurrent connections. This makes it possible to limit the load on the
server during normal loads, but push it further for important loads without
overloading the server during exceptional loads. See also the "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>"

requested URI beginning at the leading '/' of the path component. That means
that no trailing slash should be used after &lt;prefix&gt;. All invalid requests
will be rejected, and all non-GET or HEAD requests will be normally served by
the server. Note that since the response is completely forged, no header
mangling nor cookie insertion is possible in the response. However, cookies in
requests are still analyzed, making this solution completely usable to direct
users to a remote location in case of local disaster. Main use consists in
increasing bandwidth for static servers by having the clients directly

full speed. Just as with every other time-based parameter, it can be entered
in any other explicit unit among { us, ms, s, m, h, d }. The speed grows
linearly from 0 to 100% during this time. The limitation applies to two
parameters :

- maxconn: the number of connections accepted by the server will grow from 1
  to 100% of the usual dynamic limit defined by (minconn,maxconn,fullconn).

- weight: when the backend uses a dynamic weighted algorithm, the weight
  grows linearly from 1 to 100%. In this case, the weight is updated at every

<small>5.3.</small> Server IP address resolution using DNS</h3> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy allows using a host name on the server line to retrieve its IP address
using name servers. By default, HAProxy resolves the name when parsing the
configuration file, at startup and cache the result for the process's life.
This is not sufficient in some cases, such as in Amazon where a server's IP
can change after a reboot or an ELB Virtual IP can change based on current
workload.
This chapter describes how HAProxy can be configured to process server's name
resolution at run time.
Whether run time server name resolution has been enable or not, HAProxy will
carry on doing the first resolution when parsing the configuration.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-5.3.1">
<small>5.3.1.</small> Global overview</h4> <div><pre class="text">As we've seen in introduction, name resolution in HAProxy occurs at two
different steps of the process life:

  1. when starting up, HAProxy parses the server line definition and matches a
     host name. It uses libc functions to get the host name resolved. This
     resolution relies on /etc/resolv.conf file.

  2. at run time, HAProxy performs periodically name resolutions for servers
     requiring DNS resolutions.

A few other events can trigger a name resolution at run time:
  - when a server's health check ends up in a connection timeout: this may be
    because the server has a new IP address. So we need to trigger a name
    resolution to know this new IP.

When using resolvers, the server name can either be a hostname, or a SRV label.
HAProxy considers anything that starts with an underscore as a SRV label. If a
SRV label is specified, then the corresponding SRV records will be retrieved
from the DNS server, and the provided hostnames will be used. The SRV label
will be checked periodically, and if any server are added or removed, HAProxy
will automatically do the same.

A few things important to notice:
  - all the name servers are queried in the meantime. HAProxy will process the
    first valid response.

  - a resolution is considered as invalid (NX, timeout, refused), when all the
    servers return an error.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-5.3.2">
<small>5.3.2.</small> The resolvers section</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">This section is dedicated to host information related to name resolution in
HAProxy. There can be as many as resolvers section as needed. Each section can
contain many name servers.

When multiple name servers are configured in a resolvers section, then HAProxy
uses the first valid response. In case of invalid responses, only the last one
is treated. Purpose is to give the chance to a slow server to deliver a valid
answer after a fast faulty or outdated server.

When each server returns a different error type, then only the last error is
used by HAProxy. The following processing is applied on this error:

  1. HAProxy retries the same DNS query with a new query type. The A queries are
     switch to AAAA or the opposite. SRV queries are not concerned here. Timeout
     errors are also excluded.

  2. When the fallback on the query type was done (or not applicable), HAProxy
     retries the original DNS query, with the preferred query type.

  3. HAProxy retries previous steps &lt;resolve_retires&gt; times. If no valid
     response is received after that, it stops the DNS resolution and reports
     the error.

For example, with 2 name servers configured in a resolvers section, the
following scenarios are possible:

  - First response is valid and is applied directly, second response is
    ignored

  - First response is invalid and second one is valid, then second response is
    applied

  - First response is a NX domain and second one a truncated response, then
    HAProxy retries the query with a new type

  - First response is a NX domain and second one is a timeout, then HAProxy
    retries the query with a new type

  - Query timed out for both name servers, then HAProxy retries it with the
    same query type

As a DNS server may not answer all the IPs in one DNS request, HAProxy keeps
a cache of previous answers, an answer will be considered obsolete after
&lt;hold obsolete&gt; seconds without the IP returned.

<small>6.</small> Cache</h2> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy provides a cache, which was designed to perform cache on small objects
(favicon, css...). This is a minimalist low-maintenance cache which runs in
RAM.

The cache is based on a memory which is shared between processes and threads,
this memory is split in blocks of 1k.

If an object is not used anymore, it can be deleted to store a new object
independently of its expiration date. The oldest objects are deleted first
when we try to allocate a new one.

The cache uses a hash of the host header and the URI as the key.

It's possible to view the status of a cache using the Unix socket command
"show cache" consult <a href="#9.3">section 9.3</a> "Unix Socket commands" of Management Guide
for more details.

When an object is delivered from the cache, the server name in the log is
replaced by "&lt;CACHE&gt;".

<small>7.</small> Using ACLs and fetching samples</h2> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy is capable of extracting data from request or response streams, from
client or server information, from tables, environmental information etc...
The action of extracting such data is called fetching a sample. Once retrieved,
these samples may be used for various purposes such as a key to a stick-table,
but most common usages consist in matching them against predefined constant
data called patterns.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-7.1">
<small>7.1.</small> ACL basics</h3> <div><pre class="text">The use of Access Control Lists (ACL) provides a flexible solution to perform
content switching and generally to take decisions based on content extracted
from the request, the response or any environmental status. The principle is
simple :

  - extract a data sample from a stream, table or the environment
  - optionally apply some format conversion to the extracted sample
  - apply one or multiple pattern matching methods on this sample
  - perform actions only when a pattern matches the sample

The actions generally consist in blocking a request, selecting a backend, or
adding a header.

In order to define a test, the "<span class="dropdown">acl</span>" keyword is used. The syntax is :

   acl &lt;aclname&gt; &lt;criterion&gt; [flags] [operator] [&lt;value&gt;] ...

This creates a new ACL &lt;aclname&gt; or completes an existing one with new tests.
Those tests apply to the portion of request/response specified in &lt;criterion&gt;
and may be adjusted with optional flags [flags]. Some criteria also support
an operator which may be specified before the set of values. Optionally some
conversion operators may be applied to the sample, and they will be specified
as a comma-delimited list of keywords just after the first keyword. The values
are of the type supported by the criterion, and are separated by spaces.

ACL names must be formed from upper and lower case letters, digits, '-' (dash),
'_' (underscore) , '.' (dot) and ':' (colon). ACL names are case-sensitive,
which means that "my_acl" and "My_Acl" are two different ACLs.

There is no enforced limit to the number of ACLs. The unused ones do not affect
performance, they just consume a small amount of memory.

The criterion generally is the name of a sample fetch method, or one of its ACL
specific declinations. The default test method is implied by the output type of
this sample fetch method. The ACL declinations can describe alternate matching
methods of a same sample fetch method. The sample fetch methods are the only
ones supporting a conversion.

Sample fetch methods return data which can be of the following types :
  - boolean
  - integer (signed or unsigned)
  - IPv4 or IPv6 address
  - string
  - data block

Converters transform any of these data into any of these. For example, some
converters might convert a string to a lower-case string while other ones
would turn a string to an IPv4 address, or apply a netmask to an IP address.
The resulting sample is of the type of the last converter applied to the list,
which defaults to the type of the sample fetch method.

Each sample or converter returns data of a specific type, specified with its
keyword in this documentation. When an ACL is declared using a standard sample
fetch method, certain types automatically involved a default matching method
which are summarized in the table below :

   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | Sample or converter | Default         |
   |    output type      | matching method |
   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | boolean             | bool            |
   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | integer             | int             |
   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | ip                  | ip              |
   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | string              | str             |
   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | binary              | none, use "-m"  |
   +---------------------+-----------------+

Note that in order to match a binary samples, it is mandatory to specify a
matching method, see below.

The ACL engine can match these types against patterns of the following types :
  - boolean
  - integer or integer range
  - IP address / network
  - string (exact, substring, suffix, prefix, subdir, domain)
  - regular expression
  - hex block

The following ACL flags are currently supported :

   -i : ignore case during matching of all subsequent patterns.
   -f : load patterns from a file.
   -m : use a specific pattern matching method
   -n : forbid the DNS resolutions
   -M : load the file pointed by -f like a map file.
   -u : force the unique id of the ACL
   -- : force end of flags. Useful when a string looks like one of the flags.

The "-f" flag is followed by the name of a file from which all lines will be
read as individual values. It is even possible to pass multiple "-f" arguments
if the patterns are to be loaded from multiple files. Empty lines as well as
lines beginning with a sharp ('#') will be ignored. All leading spaces and tabs
will be stripped. If it is absolutely necessary to insert a valid pattern
beginning with a sharp, just prefix it with a space so that it is not taken for
a comment. Depending on the data type and match method, HAProxy may load the
lines into a binary tree, allowing very fast lookups. This is true for IPv4 and
exact string matching. In this case, duplicates will automatically be removed.

The "-M" flag allows an ACL to use a map file. If this flag is set, the file is
parsed as two column file. The first column contains the patterns used by the
ACL, and the second column contain the samples. The sample can be used later by
a map. This can be useful in some rare cases where an ACL would just be used to
check for the existence of a pattern in a map before a mapping is applied.

The "-u" flag forces the unique id of the ACL. This unique id is used with the
socket interface to identify ACL and dynamically change its values. Note that a
file is always identified by its name even if an id is set.

Also, note that the "-i" flag applies to subsequent entries and not to entries
loaded from files preceding it. For instance :

    acl valid-ua hdr(user-agent) -f exact-ua.lst -i -f generic-ua.lst test

In this example, each line of "exact-ua.lst" will be exactly matched against
the "user-agent" header of the request. Then each line of "generic-ua" will be
case-insensitively matched. Then the word "test" will be insensitively matched
as well.

The "-m" flag is used to select a specific pattern matching method on the input
sample. All ACL-specific criteria imply a pattern matching method and generally
do not need this flag. However, this flag is useful with generic sample fetch
methods to describe how they're going to be matched against the patterns. This
is required for sample fetches which return data type for which there is no
obvious matching method (e.g. string or binary). When "-m" is specified and
followed by a pattern matching method name, this method is used instead of the
default one for the criterion. This makes it possible to match contents in ways
that were not initially planned, or with sample fetch methods which return a
string. The matching method also affects the way the patterns are parsed.

The "-n" flag forbids the dns resolutions. It is used with the load of ip files.
By default, if the parser cannot parse ip address it considers that the parsed
string is maybe a domain name and try dns resolution. The flag "-n" disable this
resolution. It is useful for detecting malformed ip lists. Note that if the DNS
server is not reachable, the HAProxy configuration parsing may last many minutes
waiting for the timeout. During this time no error messages are displayed. The
flag "-n" disable this behavior. Note also that during the runtime, this
function is disabled for the dynamic acl modifications.

There are some restrictions however. Not all methods can be used with all
sample fetch methods. Also, if "-m" is used in conjunction with "-f", it must
be placed first. The pattern matching method must be one of the following :

  - "found" : only check if the requested sample could be found in the stream,
              but do not compare it against any pattern. It is recommended not
              to pass any pattern to avoid confusion. This matching method is
              particularly useful to detect presence of certain contents such
              as headers, cookies, etc... even if they are empty and without
              comparing them to anything nor counting them.

  - "<span class="dropdown">bool</span>"  : check the value as a boolean. It can only be applied to fetches
              which return a boolean or integer value, and takes no pattern.
              Value zero or false does not match, all other values do match.

  - "<a href="#int">int</a>"   : match the value as an integer. It can be used with integer and
              boolean samples. Boolean false is integer 0, true is integer 1.

  - "ip"    : match the value as an IPv4 or IPv6 address. It is compatible
              with IP address samples only, so it is implied and never needed.

  - "<a href="#bin">bin</a>"   : match the contents against a hexadecimal string representing a
              binary sequence. This may be used with binary or string samples.

  - "len"   : match the sample's length as an integer. This may be used with
              binary or string samples.

  - "<a href="#str">str</a>"   : exact match : match the contents against a string. This may be
              used with binary or string samples.

  - "<a href="#sub">sub</a>"   : substring match : check that the contents contain at least one of
              the provided string patterns. This may be used with binary or
              string samples.

  - "reg"   : regex match : match the contents against a list of regular
              expressions. This may be used with binary or string samples.

  - "beg"   : prefix match : check that the contents begin like the provided
              string patterns. This may be used with binary or string samples.

  - "end"   : suffix match : check that the contents end like the provided
              string patterns. This may be used with binary or string samples.

  - "dir"   : subdir match : check that a slash-delimited portion of the
              contents exactly matches one of the provided string patterns.
              This may be used with binary or string samples.

  - "dom"   : domain match : check that a dot-delimited portion of the contents
              exactly match one of the provided string patterns. This may be
              used with binary or string samples.

For example, to quickly detect the presence of cookie "JSESSIONID" in an HTTP
request, it is possible to do :

    acl jsess_present cook(JSESSIONID) -m found

In order to apply a regular expression on the 500 first bytes of data in the
buffer, one would use the following acl :

    acl script_tag payload(0,500) -m reg -i &lt;script&gt;

On systems where the regex library is much slower when using "-i", it is
possible to convert the sample to lowercase before matching, like this :

    acl script_tag payload(0,500),lower -m reg &lt;script&gt;

All ACL-specific criteria imply a default matching method. Most often, these
criteria are composed by concatenating the name of the original sample fetch
method and the matching method. For example, "hdr_beg" applies the "beg" match
to samples retrieved using the "<a href="#hdr">hdr</a>" fetch method. Since all ACL-specific
criteria rely on a sample fetch method, it is always possible instead to use
the original sample fetch method and the explicit matching method using "-m".

If an alternate match is specified using "-m" on an ACL-specific criterion,
the matching method is simply applied to the underlying sample fetch method.
For example, all ACLs below are exact equivalent :

    acl short_form  hdr_beg(host)        www.
    acl alternate1  hdr_beg(host) -m beg www.
    acl alternate2  hdr_dom(host) -m beg www.
    acl alternate3  hdr(host)     -m beg www.


The table below summarizes the compatibility matrix between sample or converter
types and the pattern types to fetch against. It indicates for each compatible
combination the name of the matching method to be used, surrounded with angle
brackets "&gt;" and "&lt;" when the method is the default one and will work by
default without "-m".

<small>7.1.1.</small> Matching booleans</h4> <div><pre class="text">In order to match a boolean, no value is needed and all values are ignored.
Boolean matching is used by default for all fetch methods of type "boolean".
When boolean matching is used, the fetched value is returned as-is, which means
that a boolean "true" will always match and a boolean "false" will never match.

Boolean matching may also be enforced using "-m bool" on fetch methods which
return an integer value. Then, integer value 0 is converted to the boolean
"false" and all other values are converted to "true".
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-7.1.2">
<small>7.1.2.</small> Matching integers</h4> <div><pre class="text">Integer matching applies by default to integer fetch methods. It can also be
enforced on boolean fetches using "-m int". In this case, "false" is converted
to the integer 0, and "true" is converted to the integer 1.

Integer matching also supports integer ranges and operators. Note that integer
matching only applies to positive values. A range is a value expressed with a
lower and an upper bound separated with a colon, both of which may be omitted.

For instance, "1024:65535" is a valid range to represent a range of
unprivileged ports, and "1024:" would also work. "0:1023" is a valid
representation of privileged ports, and ":1023" would also work.

As a special case, some ACL functions support decimal numbers which are in fact
two integers separated by a dot. This is used with some version checks for
instance. All integer properties apply to those decimal numbers, including
ranges and operators.

For an easier usage, comparison operators are also supported. Note that using
operators with ranges does not make much sense and is strongly discouraged.
Similarly, it does not make much sense to perform order comparisons with a set
of values.

Available operators for integer matching are :

  eq : true if the tested value equals at least one value
  ge : true if the tested value is greater than or equal to at least one value
  gt : true if the tested value is greater than at least one value
  le : true if the tested value is less than or equal to at least one value
  lt : true if the tested value is less than at least one value

For instance, the following ACL matches any negative Content-Length header :

  acl negative-length hdr_val(content-length) lt 0

This one matches SSL versions between 3.0 and 3.1 (inclusive) :

  acl sslv3 req_ssl_ver 3:3.1

<pre class="text">String matching applies to string or binary fetch methods, and exists in 6
different forms :

  - exact match     (-m str) : the extracted string must exactly match the
    patterns;

  - substring match (-m sub) : the patterns are looked up inside the
    extracted string, and the ACL matches if any of them is found inside;

  - prefix match    (-m beg) : the patterns are compared with the beginning of
    the extracted string, and the ACL matches if any of them matches.

  - suffix match    (-m end) : the patterns are compared with the end of the
    extracted string, and the ACL matches if any of them matches.

  - subdir match    (-m dir) : the patterns are looked up inside the extracted
    string, delimited with slashes ("/"), and the ACL matches if any of them
    matches.

  - domain match    (-m dom) : the patterns are looked up inside the extracted
    string, delimited with dots ("."), and the ACL matches if any of them
    matches.

String matching applies to verbatim strings as they are passed, with the
exception of the backslash ("\") which makes it possible to escape some
characters such as the space. If the "-i" flag is passed before the first
string, then the matching will be performed ignoring the case. In order
to match the string "-i", either set it second, or pass the "--" flag
before the first string. Same applies of course to match the string "--".

Do not use string matches for binary fetches which might contain null bytes
(0x00), as the comparison stops at the occurrence of the first null byte.
Instead, convert the binary fetch to a hex string with the hex converter first.

</div>  <h4 id="chapter-7.1.4">
<small>7.1.4.</small> Matching regular expressions (regexes)</h4> <div><pre class="text">Just like with string matching, regex matching applies to verbatim strings as
they are passed, with the exception of the backslash ("\") which makes it
possible to escape some characters such as the space. If the "-i" flag is
passed before the first regex, then the matching will be performed ignoring
the case. In order to match the string "-i", either set it second, or pass
the "--" flag before the first string. Same principle applies of course to
match the string "--".
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-7.1.5">
<small>7.1.5.</small> Matching arbitrary data blocks</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">It is possible to match some extracted samples against a binary block which may
not safely be represented as a string. For this, the patterns must be passed as
a series of hexadecimal digits in an even number, when the match method is set
to binary. Each sequence of two digits will represent a byte. The hexadecimal
digits may be used upper or lower case.
</pre>
<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example :</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code><span class="comment"># match "Hello\n" in the input stream (\x48 \x65 \x6c \x6c \x6f \x0a)</span>

</code></pre> </div>
</div>  <h4 id="chapter-7.1.6">
<small>7.1.6.</small> Matching IPv4 and IPv6 addresses</h4> <div><pre class="text">IPv4 addresses values can be specified either as plain addresses or with a
netmask appended, in which case the IPv4 address matches whenever it is
within the network. Plain addresses may also be replaced with a resolvable
host name, but this practice is generally discouraged as it makes it more
difficult to read and debug configurations. If hostnames are used, you should
at least ensure that they are present in /etc/hosts so that the configuration
does not depend on any random DNS match at the moment the configuration is
parsed.

The dotted IPv4 address notation is supported in both regular as well as the
abbreviated form with all-0-octets omitted:

    +------------------+------------------+------------------+
    |   Example 1      |     Example 2    |     Example 3    |
    +------------------+------------------+------------------+
    |  192.168.0.1     |   10.0.0.12      |   127.0.0.1      |
    |  192.168.1       |   10.12          |   127.1          |
    |  192.168.0.1/22  |   10.0.0.12/8    |   127.0.0.1/8    |
    |  192.168.1/22    |   10.12/8        |   127.1/8        |
    +------------------+------------------+------------------+

Notice that this is different from RFC 4632 CIDR address notation in which
192.168.42/24 would be equivalent to 192.168.42.0/24.

IPv6 may be entered in their usual form, with or without a netmask appended.
Only bit counts are accepted for IPv6 netmasks. In order to avoid any risk of
trouble with randomly resolved IP addresses, host names are never allowed in
IPv6 patterns.

HAProxy is also able to match IPv4 addresses with IPv6 addresses in the
following situations :
  - tested address is IPv4, pattern address is IPv4, the match applies
    in IPv4 using the supplied mask if any.
  - tested address is IPv6, pattern address is IPv6, the match applies
    in IPv6 using the supplied mask if any.
  - tested address is IPv6, pattern address is IPv4, the match applies in IPv4
    using the pattern's mask if the IPv6 address matches with 2002:IPV4::,
    ::IPV4 or ::ffff:IPV4, otherwise it fails.
  - tested address is IPv4, pattern address is IPv6, the IPv4 address is first
    converted to IPv6 by prefixing ::ffff: in front of it, then the match is
    applied in IPv6 using the supplied IPv6 mask.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-7.2">
<small>7.2.</small> Using ACLs to form conditions</h3> <div><pre class="text">Some actions are only performed upon a valid condition. A condition is a
combination of ACLs with operators. 3 operators are supported :

  - AND (implicit)
  - OR  (explicit with the "<a href="#or">or</a>" keyword or the "||" operator)
  - Negation with the exclamation mark ("!")

A condition is formed as a disjunctive form:

   [!]acl1 [!]acl2 ... [!]acln  { or [!]acl1 [!]acl2 ... [!]acln } ...

Such conditions are generally used after an "if" or "unless" statement,
indicating when the condition will trigger the action.

For instance, to block HTTP requests to the "*" URL with methods other than
"OPTIONS", as well as POST requests without content-length, and GET or HEAD
requests with a content-length greater than 0, and finally every request which
is not either GET/HEAD/POST/OPTIONS !

   acl missing_cl hdr_cnt(Content-length) eq 0
   http-request deny if HTTP_URL_STAR !METH_OPTIONS || METH_POST missing_cl
   http-request deny if METH_GET HTTP_CONTENT
   http-request deny unless METH_GET or METH_POST or METH_OPTIONS

To select a different backend for requests to static contents on the "www" site
and to every request on the "img", "video", "download" and "ftp" hosts :

   acl url_static  path_beg         /static /images /img /css
   acl url_static  path_end         .gif .png .jpg .css .js
   acl host_www    hdr_beg(host) -i www
   acl host_static hdr_beg(host) -i img. video. download. ftp.

   # now use backend "static" for all static-only hosts, and for static URLs
   # of host "www". Use backend "www" for the rest.
   use_backend static if host_static or host_www url_static
   use_backend www    if host_www

It is also possible to form rules using "anonymous ACLs". Those are unnamed ACL
expressions that are built on the fly without needing to be declared. They must
be enclosed between braces, with a space before and after each brace (because
the braces must be seen as independent words). Example :

   The following rule :

       acl missing_cl hdr_cnt(Content-length) eq 0
       http-request deny if METH_POST missing_cl

   Can also be written that way :

       http-request deny if METH_POST { hdr_cnt(Content-length) eq 0 }

It is generally not recommended to use this construct because it's a lot easier
to leave errors in the configuration when written that way. However, for very
simple rules matching only one source IP address for instance, it can make more
sense to use them than to declare ACLs with random names. Another example of
good use is the following :

   With named ACLs :

        acl site_dead nbsrv(dynamic) lt 2
        acl site_dead nbsrv(static)  lt 2
        monitor fail  if site_dead

   With anonymous ACLs :

        monitor fail if { nbsrv(dynamic) lt 2 } || { nbsrv(static) lt 2 }

See <a href="#4.2">section 4.2</a> for detailed help on the "<a href="#http-request%20deny">http-request deny</a>" and "<a href="#use_backend">use_backend</a>"
keywords.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-7.3">
<small>7.3.</small> Fetching samples</h3> <div><pre class="text">Historically, sample fetch methods were only used to retrieve data to match
against patterns using ACLs. With the arrival of stick-tables, a new class of
sample fetch methods was created, most often sharing the same syntax as their
ACL counterpart. These sample fetch methods are also known as "fetches". As
of now, ACLs and fetches have converged. All ACL fetch methods have been made
available as fetch methods, and ACLs may use any sample fetch method as well.

This section details all available sample fetch methods and their output type.
Some sample fetch methods have deprecated aliases that are used to maintain
compatibility with existing configurations. They are then explicitly marked as
deprecated and should not be used in new setups.

The ACL derivatives are also indicated when available, with their respective
matching methods. These ones all have a well defined default pattern matching
method, so it is never necessary (though allowed) to pass the "-m" option to
indicate how the sample will be matched using ACLs.

As indicated in the sample type versus matching compatibility matrix above,
when using a generic sample fetch method in an ACL, the "-m" option is
mandatory unless the sample type is one of boolean, integer, IPv4 or IPv6. When
the same keyword exists as an ACL keyword and as a standard fetch method, the
ACL engine will automatically pick the ACL-only one by default.

Some of these keywords support one or multiple mandatory arguments, and one or
multiple optional arguments. These arguments are strongly typed and are checked
when the configuration is parsed so that there is no risk of running with an
incorrect argument (e.g. an unresolved backend name). Fetch function arguments
are passed between parenthesis and are delimited by commas. When an argument
is optional, it will be indicated below between square brackets ('[ ]'). When
all arguments are optional, the parenthesis may be omitted.

Thus, the syntax of a standard sample fetch method is one of the following :
   - <a href="#name">name</a>
   - name(arg1)
   - name(arg1,arg2)
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-7.3.1">
<small>7.3.1.</small> Converters</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">Sample fetch methods may be combined with transformations to be applied on top
of the fetched sample (also called "converters"). These combinations form what
is called "sample expressions" and the result is a "sample". Initially this
was only supported by "<a href="#stick%20on">stick on</a>" and "<a href="#stick%20store-request">stick store-request</a>" directives but this
has now be extended to all places where samples may be used (ACLs, log-format,
unique-id-format, add-header, ...).

These transformations are enumerated as a series of specific keywords after the
sample fetch method. These keywords may equally be appended immediately after
the fetch keyword's argument, delimited by a comma. These keywords can also
support some arguments (e.g. a netmask) which must be passed in parenthesis.

A certain category of converters are bitwise and arithmetic operators which
support performing basic operations on integers. Some bitwise operations are
supported (and, or, xor, cpl) and some arithmetic operations are supported
(add, sub, mul, div, mod, neg). Some comparators are provided (odd, even, not,
bool) which make it possible to report a match without having to write an ACL.

The currently available list of transformation keywords include :

<pre class="text">Parses a binary payload and performs sanity checks regarding FIX (Financial
Information eXchange):

- checks that all tag IDs and values are not empty and the tags IDs are well
  numeric
- checks the BeginString tag is the first tag with a valid FIX version
- checks the BodyLength tag is the second one with the right body length
- checks the MsgType tag is the third tag.
- checks that last tag in the message is the CheckSum tag with a valid
  checksum

Due to current HAProxy design, only the first message sent by the client and
the server can be parsed.

This converter returns a boolean, true if the payload contains a valid FIX
message, false if not.

Expires values in responses when combined with a positive offset, or
Last-Modified values when the offset is negative.
If a unit value is specified, then consider the timestamp as either
"s" for seconds (default behavior), "ms" for milliseconds, or "us" for
microseconds since epoch. Offset is assumed to have the same unit as
input timestamp.

<div class="keyword" id="json">
<b>json</b>(<span style="color: #008">[<span style="color: #080">&lt;input-code&gt;</span>]</span>)</div>
<pre class="text">Escapes the input string and produces an ASCII output string ready to use as a
JSON string. The converter tries to decode the input string according to the
&lt;input-code&gt; parameter. It can be "ascii", "utf8", "utf8s", "utf8p" or
"utf8ps". The "ascii" decoder never fails. The "utf8" decoder detects 3 types
of errors:
 - bad UTF-8 sequence (lone continuation byte, bad number of continuation
   bytes, ...)
 - invalid range (the decoded value is within a UTF-8 prohibited range),
 - code overlong (the value is encoded with more bytes than necessary).

The UTF-8 JSON encoding can produce a "too long value" error when the UTF-8
character is greater than 0xffff because the JSON string escape specification
only authorizes 4 hex digits for the value encoding. The UTF-8 decoder exists
in 4 variants designated by a combination of two suffix letters : "p" for
"permissive" and "s" for "silently ignore". The behaviors of the decoders
are :
 - "ascii"  : never fails;
 - "utf8"   : fails on any detected errors;
 - "utf8s"  : never fails, but removes characters corresponding to errors;
 - "utf8p"  : accepts and fixes the overlong errors, but fails on any other
              error;
 - "utf8ps" : never fails, accepts and fixes the overlong errors, but removes
              characters corresponding to the other errors.

This converter is particularly useful for building properly escaped JSON for
logging to servers which consume JSON-formatted traffic logs.

  Search the input value from &lt;map_file&gt; using the &lt;match_type&gt; matching method,

  input value cannot be found in the &lt;map_file&gt;, the converter returns the

  acts as if no input value could be fetched. If the &lt;match_type&gt; is not set, it
  defaults to "<a href="#str">str</a>". Likewise, if the &lt;output_type&gt; is not set, it defaults to
  "<a href="#str">str</a>". For convenience, the "<a href="#map">map</a>" keyword is an alias for "map_str" and maps a
  string to another string.

  It is important to avoid overlapping between the keys : IP addresses and
  strings are stored in trees, so the first of the finest match will be used.
  Other keys are stored in lists, so the first matching occurrence will be used.

<pre class="text">This extracts the protocol buffers message field in raw mode of an input binary
sample representation of a protocol buffer message with &lt;field_number&gt; as field
number (dotted notation) if &lt;field_type&gt; is not present, or as an integer sample
if this field is present (see also "<a href="#ungrpc">ungrpc</a>" below).
The list of the authorized types is the following one: "int32", "int64", "uint32",
"uint64", "sint32", "sint64", "<span class="dropdown">bool</span>", "enum" for the "varint" wire type 0
"fixed64", "sfixed64", "double" for the 64bit wire type 1, "fixed32", "sfixed32",
"float" for the wire type 5. Note that "string" is considered as a length-delimited

<div class="keyword" id="regsub">

<pre class="text">Applies a regex-based substitution to the input string. It does the same
operation as the well-known "sed" utility with "s/&lt;regex&gt;/&lt;subst&gt;/". By
default it will replace in the input string the first occurrence of the
largest part matching the regular expression &lt;regex&gt; with the substitution
string &lt;subst&gt;. It is possible to replace all occurrences instead by adding
the flag "g" in the third argument &lt;flags&gt;. It is also possible to make the
regex case insensitive by adding the flag "i" in &lt;flags&gt;. Since &lt;flags&gt; is a
string, it is made up from the concatenation of all desired flags. Thus if
both "i" and "g" are desired, using "gi" or "ig" will have the same effect.
The first use of this converter is to replace certain characters or sequence
of characters with other ones.

It is highly recommended to enclose the regex part using protected quotes to
improve clarity and never have a closing parenthesis from the regex mixed up
with the parenthesis from the function. Just like in Bourne shell, the first
level of quotes is processed when delimiting word groups on the line, a
second level is usable for argument. It is recommended to use single quotes
outside since these ones do not try to resolve backslashes nor dollar signs.

<pre class="text">This extracts the protocol buffers message field in raw mode of an input binary
sample representation of a gRPC message with &lt;field_number&gt; as field number
(dotted notation) if &lt;field_type&gt; is not present, or as an integer sample if this
field is present.
The list of the authorized types is the following one: "int32", "int64", "uint32",
"uint64", "sint32", "sint64", "<span class="dropdown">bool</span>", "enum" for the "varint" wire type 0
"fixed64", "sfixed64", "double" for the 64bit wire type 1, "fixed32", "sfixed32",
"float" for the wire type 5. Note that "string" is considered as a length-delimited
type, so it does not require any &lt;field_type&gt; argument to be extracted.

<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Example:</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>// with such a protocol buffer .proto file content adapted from
// https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/protos/route_guide.proto

<pre class="text">let's say a body request is made of a "Rectangle" object value (two PPoint
protocol buffers messages), the four protocol buffers fields could be
extracted with these "<a href="#ungrpc">ungrpc</a>" directives:

  req.body,ungrpc(48.59.1,int32) # "latitude" of "lo" first PPoint
  req.body,ungrpc(48.59.2,int32) # "longitude" of "lo" first PPoint
  req.body,ungrpc(49.59.1,int32) # "latitude" of "hi" second PPoint
  req.body,ungrpc(49.59.2,int32) # "longitude" of "hi" second PPoint

We could also extract the intermediary 48.59 field as a binary sample as follows:

  req.body,ungrpc(48.59)

As a gRPC message is always made of a gRPC header followed by protocol buffers
messages, in the previous example the "latitude" of "lo" first PPoint
could be extracted with these equivalent directives:

  req.body,ungrpc(48.59),protobuf(1,int32)
  req.body,ungrpc(48),protobuf(59.1,int32)
  req.body,ungrpc(48),protobuf(59),protobuf(1,int32)

Note that the first convert must be "<a href="#ungrpc">ungrpc</a>", the remaining ones must be
"<a href="#protobuf">protobuf</a>" and only the last one may have or not a second argument to
interpret the previous binary sample.

ACL to return a sorry page to new users when it becomes certain they will get
a degraded service, or to pass to the backend servers in a header so that
they decide to work in degraded mode or to disable some functions to speed up
the processing a bit. Note that in the event there would not be any active
server anymore, twice the number of queued connections would be considered as
the measured value. This is a fair estimate, as we expect one server to get
back soon anyway, but we still prefer to send new traffic to another backend
if in better shape. See also the "<a href="#queue">queue</a>", "<a href="#be_conn">be_conn</a>", and "<a href="#be_sess_rate">be_sess_rate</a>"

<b>connslots</b>(<span style="color: #008">[<span style="color: #080">&lt;backend&gt;</span>]</span>) : integer</div>
<pre class="text">Returns an integer value corresponding to the number of connection slots
still available in the backend, by totaling the maximum amount of
connections on all servers and the maximum queue size. This is probably only
used with ACLs.

The basic idea here is to be able to measure the number of connection "slots"
still available (connection + queue), so that anything beyond that (intended
usage; see "<a href="#use_backend">use_backend</a>" keyword) can be redirected to a different backend.

'connslots' = number of available server connection slots, + number of
available server queue slots.

Note that while "<a href="#fe_conn">fe_conn</a>" may be used, "<a href="#connslots">connslots</a>" comes in especially
useful when you have a case of traffic going to one single ip, splitting into
multiple backends (perhaps using ACLs to do name-based load balancing) and
you want to be able to differentiate between different backends, and their
available "<a href="#connslots">connslots</a>". Also, whereas "<span class="dropdown">nbsrv</span>" only measures servers that are
actually *down*, this fetch is more fine-grained and looks into the number of
available connection slots as well. See also "<a href="#queue">queue</a>" and "<a href="#avg_queue">avg_queue</a>".

OTHER CAVEATS AND NOTES: at this point in time, the code does not take care
of dynamic connections. Also, if any of the server maxconn, or maxqueue is 0,
then this fetch clearly does not make sense, in which case the value returned
will be -1.

<div class="keyword" id="cpu_calls">
<b>cpu_calls</b> : integer</div>
<pre class="text">Returns the number of calls to the task processing the stream or current
request since it was allocated. This number is reset for each new request on
the same connections in case of HTTP keep-alive. This value should usually be
low and stable (around 2 calls for a typically simple request) but may become
high if some processing (compression, caching or analysis) is performed. This
is purely for performance monitoring purposes.

<div class="keyword" id="cpu_ns_avg">
<b>cpu_ns_avg</b> : integer</div>
<pre class="text">Returns the average number of nanoseconds spent in each call to the task
processing the stream or current request. This number is reset for each new
request on the same connections in case of HTTP keep-alive. This value
indicates the overall cost of processing the request or the connection for
each call. There is no good nor bad value but the time spent in a call
automatically causes latency for other processing (see lat_ns_avg below),
and may affect other connection's apparent response time. Certain operations
like compression, complex regex matching or heavy Lua operations may directly
affect this value, and having it in the logs will make it easier to spot the
faulty processing that needs to be fixed to recover decent performance.
Note: this value is exactly cpu_ns_tot divided by cpu_calls.

indicates the overall cost of processing the request or the connection for

response time. Certain operations like compression, complex regex matching or
heavy Lua operations may directly affect this value, and having it in the
logs will make it easier to spot the faulty processing that needs to be fixed

It is useful combined with the http_date converter.

&lt;unit&gt; is facultative, and can be set to "s" for seconds (default behavior),
"ms" for  milliseconds or "us" for microseconds.
If unit is set, return value is an integer reflecting either seconds,
milliseconds or microseconds since epoch, plus offset.

handling the stream is woken up and the moment it is effectively called. This
number is reset for each new request on the same connections in case of HTTP
keep-alive. This value indicates the overall latency inflicted to the current
request by all other requests being processed in parallel, and is a direct
indicator of perceived performance due to noisy neighbours. In order to keep
the value low, it is possible to reduce the scheduler's run queue depth using
"<a href="#tune.runqueue-depth">tune.runqueue-depth</a>", to reduce the number of concurrent events processed at

<b>lat_ns_tot</b> : integer</div>
<pre class="text">Returns the total number of nanoseconds spent between the moment the task

may intuitively seem that the total latency adds to a transfer time, it is
almost never true because while a task waits for the CPU, network buffers
continue to fill up and the next call will process more at once. The value
may be artificially high due to a high cpu_calls count, for example when
processing many HTTP chunks, and for this reason it is often preferred to log
lat_ns_avg instead, which is a more relevant performance indicator.

including all the connections in server queues. If no backend name is
specified, the current one is used, but it is also possible to check another
one. This is useful with ACLs or to pass statistics to backend servers. This
can be used to take actions when queuing goes above a known level, generally
indicating a surge of traffic or a massive slowdown on the servers. One
possible action could be to reject new users but still accept old ones. See

<b>src</b> : ip</div>
<pre class="text">This is the source IPv4 address of the client of the session. It is of type
IP and works on both IPv4 and IPv6 tables. On IPv6 tables, IPv4 addresses are
mapped to their IPv6 equivalent, according to RFC 4291. Note that it is the
TCP-level source address which is used, and not the address of a client
behind a proxy. However if the "<a href="#accept-proxy">accept-proxy</a>" or "<a href="#accept-netscaler-cip">accept-netscaler-cip</a>" bind
directive is used, it can be the address of a client behind another
PROXY-protocol compatible component for all rule sets except
"<a href="#tcp-request%20connection">tcp-request connection</a>" which sees the real address. When the incoming
connection passed through address translation or redirection involving
connection tracking, the original destination address before the redirection
will be reported. On Linux systems, the source and destination may seldom
appear reversed if the nf_conntrack_tcp_loose sysctl is set, because a late
response may reopen a timed out connection and switch what is believed to be
the source and the destination.

<small>7.3.5.</small> Fetching samples from buffer contents (Layer 6)</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">Fetching samples from buffer contents is a bit different from the previous
sample fetches above because the sampled data are ephemeral. These data can
only be used when they're available and will be lost when they're forwarded.
For this reason, samples fetched from buffer contents during a request cannot
be used in a response for example. Even while the data are being fetched, they
can change. Sometimes it is necessary to set some delays or combine multiple
sample fetch methods to ensure that the expected data are complete and usable,
for example through TCP request content inspection. Please see the "tcp-request
content" keyword for more detailed information on the subject.

Warning : Following sample fetches are ignored if used from HTTP proxies. They
          only deal with raw contents found in the buffers. On their side,
          HTTP proxies use structured content. Thus raw representation of
          these data are meaningless. A warning is emitted if an ACL relies on
          one of the following sample fetches. But it is not possible to detect
          all invalid usage (for instance inside a log-format string or a

contain the user name of the client connecting to the server if properly
configured on the client. The "MSTSHASH" cookie is often used as well for
session stickiness to servers.

This differs from "balance rdp-cookie" in that any balancing algorithm may be
used and thus the distribution of clients to backend servers is not linked to
a hash of the RDP cookie. It is envisaged that using a balancing algorithm
such as "balance roundrobin" or "balance leastconn" will lead to a more even
distribution of clients to backend servers than the hash used by "balance

<div class="keyword" id="base">
<b>base</b> : string</div>
<pre class="text">This returns the concatenation of the first Host header and the path part of
the request, which starts at the first slash and ends before the question

well as to improve shared caches efficiency. Using this with a limited size
stick table also allows one to collect statistics about most commonly
requested objects by host/path. With ACLs it can allow simple content
switching rules involving the host and the path at the same time, such as
"www.example.com/favicon.ico". See also "<a href="#path">path</a>" and "uri".

This is useful if you need to process headers that are defined to be a list
of values, such as Accept, or X-Forwarded-For. If full-line headers are
desired instead, use req.fhdr(). Please carefully check RFC 7231 to know how
certain headers are supposed to be parsed. Also, some of them are case
insensitive (e.g. Connection).

When used from an ACL, all occurrences are iterated over until a match is

Optionally, a specific occurrence might be specified as a position number.
Positive values indicate a position from the first occurrence, with 1 being

of every header is checked. The parser strictly adheres to the format
described in RFC7239, with the extension that IPv4 addresses may optionally
be followed by a colon (':') and a valid decimal port number (0 to 65535),
which will be silently dropped. All other forms will not match and will

"<a href="#path">path</a>" is preferred over using "<a href="#url">url</a>", because clients may send a full URL as

string, which begins after either '?' or &lt;delim&gt;, and which ends before '&amp;',
';' or &lt;delim&gt;. The parameter name is case-sensitive. If no name is given,
any parameter will match, and the first one will be returned. The result is
a string corresponding to the value of the parameter &lt;name&gt; as presented in
the request (no URL decoding is performed). This can be used for session
stickiness based on a client ID, to extract an application cookie passed as a
URL parameter, or in ACLs to apply some checks. Note that the ACL version of
this fetch iterates over multiple parameters and will iteratively report all
parameters values if no name is given

<small>8.</small> Logging</h2> <div><pre class="text">One of HAProxy's strong points certainly lies is its precise logs. It probably
provides the finest level of information available for such a product, which is
very important for troubleshooting complex environments. Standard information
provided in logs include client ports, TCP/HTTP state timers, precise session
state at termination and precise termination cause, information about decisions
to direct traffic to a server, and of course the ability to capture arbitrary
headers.

In order to improve administrators reactivity, it offers a great transparency
about encountered problems, both internal and external, and it is possible to
send logs to different sources at the same time with different level filters :

  - global process-level logs (system errors, start/stop, etc..)
  - per-instance system and internal errors (lack of resource, bugs, ...)
  - per-instance external troubles (servers up/down, max connections)
  - per-instance activity (client connections), either at the establishment or
    at the termination.
  - per-request control of log-level, e.g.
        http-request set-log-level silent if sensitive_request

The ability to distribute different levels of logs to different log servers
allow several production teams to interact and to fix their problems as soon
as possible. For example, the system team might monitor system-wide errors,
while the application team might be monitoring the up/down for their servers in
real time, and the security team might analyze the activity logs with one hour
delay.

HTTP request, HTTP return code, number of bytes transmitted, conditions
in which the session ended, and even exchanged cookies values. For example
track a particular user's problems. All messages may be sent to up to two
syslog servers. Check the "<span class="dropdown">log</span>" keyword in <a href="#4.2">section 4.2</a> for more information
about log facilities.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-8.2">
<small>8.2.</small> Log formats</h3> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy supports 5 log formats. Several fields are common between these formats
and will be detailed in the following sections. A few of them may vary
slightly with the configuration, due to indicators specific to certain
options. The supported formats are as follows :

  - the default format, which is very basic and very rarely used. It only
    provides very basic information about the incoming connection at the moment
    it is accepted : source IP:port, destination IP:port, and frontend-name.
    This mode will eventually disappear so it will not be described to great
    extents.

  - the TCP format, which is more advanced. This format is enabled when "option
    tcplog" is set on the frontend. HAProxy will then usually wait for the
    connection to terminate before logging. This format provides much richer
    information, such as timers, connection counts, queue size, etc... This
    format is recommended for pure TCP proxies.

  - the HTTP format, which is the most advanced for HTTP proxying. This format
    is enabled when "<a href="#option%20httplog">option httplog</a>" is set on the frontend. It provides the
    same information as the TCP format with some HTTP-specific fields such as
    the request, the status code, and captures of headers and cookies. This
    format is recommended for HTTP proxies.

  - the CLF HTTP format, which is equivalent to the HTTP format, but with the
    fields arranged in the same order as the CLF format. In this mode, all
    timers, captures, flags, etc... appear one per field after the end of the
    common fields, in the same order they appear in the standard HTTP format.

  - the custom log format, allows you to make your own log line.

Next sections will go deeper into details for each of these formats. Format
specification will be performed on a "<a href="#field">field</a>" basis. Unless stated otherwise, a
field is a portion of text delimited by any number of spaces. Since syslog
servers are susceptible of inserting fields at the beginning of a line, it is
always assumed that the first field is the one containing the process name and
identifier.

Note : Since log lines may be quite long, the log examples in sections below
       might be broken into multiple lines. The example log lines will be
       prefixed with 3 closing angle brackets ('&gt;&gt;&gt;') and each time a log is
       broken into multiple lines, each non-final line will end with a
       backslash ('\') and the next line will start indented by two characters.

  - "source_ip" is the IP address of the client which initiated the connection.
  - "source_port" is the TCP port of the client which initiated the connection.
  - "destination_ip" is the IP address the client connected to.
  - "destination_port" is the TCP port the client connected to.
  - "frontend_name" is the name of the frontend (or listener) which received
    and processed the connection.
  - "mode is the mode the frontend is operating (TCP or HTTP).

In case of a UNIX socket, the source and destination addresses are marked as
"unix:" and the ports reflect the internal ID of the socket which accepted the
connection (the same ID as reported in the stats).

It is advised not to use this deprecated format for newer installations as it
will eventually disappear.

<small>8.2.2.</small> TCP log format</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">The TCP format is used when "<a href="#option%20tcplog">option tcplog</a>" is specified in the frontend, and
is the recommended format for pure TCP proxies. It provides a lot of precious
information for troubleshooting. Since this format includes timers and byte
counts, the log is normally emitted at the end of the session. It can be
emitted earlier if "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" is specified, which makes sense in most
environments with long sessions such as remote terminals. Sessions which match
the "<a href="#monitor">monitor</a>" rules are never logged. It is also possible not to emit logs for
sessions for which no data were exchanged between the client and the server, by
specifying "<a href="#option%20dontlognull">option dontlognull</a>" in the frontend. Successful connections will
not be logged if "<a href="#option%20dontlog-normal">option dontlog-normal</a>" is specified in the frontend. A few
fields may slightly vary depending on some configuration options, those are
marked with a star ('*') after the field name below.

Detailed fields description :
  - "client_ip" is the IP address of the client which initiated the TCP
    connection to HAProxy. If the connection was accepted on a UNIX socket
    instead, the IP address would be replaced with the word "unix". Note that
    when the connection is accepted on a socket configured with "<a href="#accept-proxy">accept-proxy</a>"
    and the PROXY protocol is correctly used, or with a "<a href="#accept-netscaler-cip">accept-netscaler-cip</a>"
    and the NetScaler Client IP insertion protocol is correctly used, then the
    logs will reflect the forwarded connection's information.

  - "client_port" is the TCP port of the client which initiated the connection.
    If the connection was accepted on a UNIX socket instead, the port would be
    replaced with the ID of the accepting socket, which is also reported in the
    stats interface.

  - "accept_date" is the exact date when the connection was received by HAProxy
    (which might be very slightly different from the date observed on the
    network if there was some queuing in the system's backlog). This is usually
    the same date which may appear in any upstream firewall's log. When used in
    HTTP mode, the accept_date field will be reset to the first moment the
    connection is ready to receive a new request (end of previous response for
    HTTP/1, immediately after previous request for HTTP/2).

  - "frontend_name" is the name of the frontend (or listener) which received
    and processed the connection.

  - "backend_name" is the name of the backend (or listener) which was selected
    to manage the connection to the server. This will be the same as the
    frontend if no switching rule has been applied, which is common for TCP
    applications.

  - "server_name" is the name of the last server to which the connection was
    sent, which might differ from the first one if there were connection errors
    and a redispatch occurred. Note that this server belongs to the backend
    which processed the request. If the connection was aborted before reaching
    a server, "&lt;NOSRV&gt;" is indicated instead of a server name.

  - "Tw" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting in the various queues.
    It can be "-1" if the connection was aborted before reaching the queue.
    See "Timers" below for more details.

  - "Tc" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting for the connection to
    establish to the final server, including retries. It can be "-1" if the
    connection was aborted before a connection could be established. See
    "Timers" below for more details.

  - "Tt" is the total time in milliseconds elapsed between the accept and the
    last close. It covers all possible processing. There is one exception, if
    "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" was specified, then the time counting stops at the moment
    the log is emitted. In this case, a '+' sign is prepended before the value,
    indicating that the final one will be larger. See "Timers" below for more
    details.

  - "bytes_read" is the total number of bytes transmitted from the server to
    the client when the log is emitted. If "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" is specified, the
    this value will be prefixed with a '+' sign indicating that the final one
    may be larger. Please note that this value is a 64-bit counter, so log
    analysis tools must be able to handle it without overflowing.

  - "termination_state" is the condition the session was in when the session
    ended. This indicates the session state, which side caused the end of
    session to happen, and for what reason (timeout, error, ...). The normal
    flags should be "--", indicating the session was closed by either end with
    no data remaining in buffers. See below "Session state at disconnection"
    for more details.

  - "actconn" is the total number of concurrent connections on the process when
    the session was logged. It is useful to detect when some per-process system
    limits have been reached. For instance, if actconn is close to 512 when
    multiple connection errors occur, chances are high that the system limits
    the process to use a maximum of 1024 file descriptors and that all of them
    are used. See <a href="#3">section 3</a> "Global parameters" to find how to tune the system.

  - "feconn" is the total number of concurrent connections on the frontend when
    the session was logged. It is useful to estimate the amount of resource
    required to sustain high loads, and to detect when the frontend's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>"
    has been reached. Most often when this value increases by huge jumps, it is
    because there is congestion on the backend servers, but sometimes it can be
    caused by a denial of service attack.

  - "beconn" is the total number of concurrent connections handled by the
    backend when the session was logged. It includes the total number of
    concurrent connections active on servers as well as the number of
    connections pending in queues. It is useful to estimate the amount of
    additional servers needed to support high loads for a given application.
    Most often when this value increases by huge jumps, it is because there is
    congestion on the backend servers, but sometimes it can be caused by a
    denial of service attack.

  - "<a href="#srv_conn">srv_conn</a>" is the total number of concurrent connections still active on
    the server when the session was logged. It can never exceed the server's
    configured "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter. If this value is very often close or equal
    to the server's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>", it means that traffic regulation is involved a
    lot, meaning that either the server's maxconn value is too low, or that
    there aren't enough servers to process the load with an optimal response
    time. When only one of the server's "<a href="#srv_conn">srv_conn</a>" is high, it usually means
    that this server has some trouble causing the connections to take longer to
    be processed than on other servers.

  - "<a href="#retries">retries</a>" is the number of connection retries experienced by this session
    when trying to connect to the server. It must normally be zero, unless a
    server is being stopped at the same moment the connection was attempted.
    Frequent retries generally indicate either a network problem between
    HAProxy and the server, or a misconfigured system backlog on the server
    preventing new connections from being queued. This field may optionally be
    prefixed with a '+' sign, indicating that the session has experienced a
    redispatch after the maximal retry count has been reached on the initial
    server. In this case, the server name appearing in the log is the one the
    connection was redispatched to, and not the first one, though both may
    sometimes be the same in case of hashing for instance. So as a general rule
    of thumb, when a '+' is present in front of the retry count, this count
    should not be attributed to the logged server.

  - "<span class="dropdown">srv_queue</span>" is the total number of requests which were processed before
    this one in the server queue. It is zero when the request has not gone
    through the server queue. It makes it possible to estimate the approximate
    server's response time by dividing the time spent in queue by the number of
    requests in the queue. It is worth noting that if a session experiences a
    redispatch and passes through two server queues, their positions will be
    cumulative. A request should not pass through both the server queue and the
    backend queue unless a redispatch occurs.

  - "backend_queue" is the total number of requests which were processed before
    this one in the backend's global queue. It is zero when the request has not
    gone through the global queue. It makes it possible to estimate the average
    queue length, which easily translates into a number of missing servers when
    divided by a server's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter. It is worth noting that if a
    session experiences a redispatch, it may pass twice in the backend's queue,
    and then both positions will be cumulative. A request should not pass
    through both the server queue and the backend queue unless a redispatch
    occurs.

<small>8.2.3.</small> HTTP log format</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">The HTTP format is the most complete and the best suited for HTTP proxies. It
is enabled by when "<a href="#option%20httplog">option httplog</a>" is specified in the frontend. It provides
the same level of information as the TCP format with additional features which
are specific to the HTTP protocol. Just like the TCP format, the log is usually
emitted at the end of the session, unless "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" is specified, which
generally only makes sense for download sites. A session which matches the
"<a href="#monitor">monitor</a>" rules will never logged. It is also possible not to log sessions for
which no data were sent by the client by specifying "<a href="#option%20dontlognull">option dontlognull</a>" in the
frontend. Successful connections will not be logged if "<a href="#option%20dontlog-normal">option dontlog-normal</a>"

Detailed fields description :
  - "client_ip" is the IP address of the client which initiated the TCP
    connection to HAProxy. If the connection was accepted on a UNIX socket
    instead, the IP address would be replaced with the word "unix". Note that
    when the connection is accepted on a socket configured with "<a href="#accept-proxy">accept-proxy</a>"
    and the PROXY protocol is correctly used, or with a "<a href="#accept-netscaler-cip">accept-netscaler-cip</a>"
    and the NetScaler Client IP insertion protocol is correctly used, then the
    logs will reflect the forwarded connection's information.

  - "client_port" is the TCP port of the client which initiated the connection.
    If the connection was accepted on a UNIX socket instead, the port would be
    replaced with the ID of the accepting socket, which is also reported in the
    stats interface.

  - "request_date" is the exact date when the first byte of the HTTP request
    was received by HAProxy (log field %tr).

  - "frontend_name" is the name of the frontend (or listener) which received
    and processed the connection.

  - "backend_name" is the name of the backend (or listener) which was selected
    to manage the connection to the server. This will be the same as the
    frontend if no switching rule has been applied.

  - "server_name" is the name of the last server to which the connection was
    sent, which might differ from the first one if there were connection errors
    and a redispatch occurred. Note that this server belongs to the backend
    which processed the request. If the request was aborted before reaching a
    server, "&lt;NOSRV&gt;" is indicated instead of a server name. If the request was
    intercepted by the stats subsystem, "&lt;STATS&gt;" is indicated instead.

  - "TR" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting for a full HTTP
    request from the client (not counting body) after the first byte was
    received. It can be "-1" if the connection was aborted before a complete
    request could be received or a bad request was received. It should
    always be very small because a request generally fits in one single packet.
    Large times here generally indicate network issues between the client and
    HAProxy or requests being typed by hand. See <a href="#8.4">section 8.4</a> "Timing Events"
    for more details.

  - "Tw" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting in the various queues.
    It can be "-1" if the connection was aborted before reaching the queue.
    See <a href="#8.4">section 8.4</a> "Timing Events" for more details.

  - "Tc" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting for the connection to
    establish to the final server, including retries. It can be "-1" if the
    request was aborted before a connection could be established. See section
    8.4 "Timing Events" for more details.

  - "Tr" is the total time in milliseconds spent waiting for the server to send
    a full HTTP response, not counting data. It can be "-1" if the request was
    aborted before a complete response could be received. It generally matches
    the server's processing time for the request, though it may be altered by
    the amount of data sent by the client to the server. Large times here on
    "GET" requests generally indicate an overloaded server. See <a href="#8.4">section 8.4</a>
    "Timing Events" for more details.

  - "Ta" is the time the request remained active in HAProxy, which is the total
    time in milliseconds elapsed between the first byte of the request was
    received and the last byte of response was sent. It covers all possible
    processing except the handshake (see Th) and idle time (see Ti). There is
    one exception, if "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" was specified, then the time counting
    stops at the moment the log is emitted. In this case, a '+' sign is
    prepended before the value, indicating that the final one will be larger.
    See <a href="#8.4">section 8.4</a> "Timing Events" for more details.

  - "status_code" is the HTTP status code returned to the client. This status
    is generally set by the server, but it might also be set by HAProxy when
    the server cannot be reached or when its response is blocked by HAProxy.

  - "bytes_read" is the total number of bytes transmitted to the client when
    the log is emitted. This does include HTTP headers. If "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" is
    specified, this value will be prefixed with a '+' sign indicating that
    the final one may be larger. Please note that this value is a 64-bit
    counter, so log analysis tools must be able to handle it without
    overflowing.

  - "captured_request_cookie" is an optional "name=value" entry indicating that
    the client had this cookie in the request. The cookie name and its maximum
    length are defined by the "<a href="#capture%20cookie">capture cookie</a>" statement in the frontend
    configuration. The field is a single dash ('-') when the option is not
    set. Only one cookie may be captured, it is generally used to track session
    ID exchanges between a client and a server to detect session crossing
    between clients due to application bugs. For more details, please consult
    the section "Capturing HTTP headers and cookies" below.

  - "captured_response_cookie" is an optional "name=value" entry indicating
    that the server has returned a cookie with its response. The cookie name
    and its maximum length are defined by the "<a href="#capture%20cookie">capture cookie</a>" statement in the
    frontend configuration. The field is a single dash ('-') when the option is
    not set. Only one cookie may be captured, it is generally used to track
    session ID exchanges between a client and a server to detect session
    crossing between clients due to application bugs. For more details, please
    consult the section "Capturing HTTP headers and cookies" below.

  - "termination_state" is the condition the session was in when the session
    ended. This indicates the session state, which side caused the end of
    session to happen, for what reason (timeout, error, ...), just like in TCP
    logs, and information about persistence operations on cookies in the last
    two characters. The normal flags should begin with "--", indicating the
    session was closed by either end with no data remaining in buffers. See
    below "Session state at disconnection" for more details.

  - "actconn" is the total number of concurrent connections on the process when
    the session was logged. It is useful to detect when some per-process system
    limits have been reached. For instance, if actconn is close to 512 or 1024
    when multiple connection errors occur, chances are high that the system
    limits the process to use a maximum of 1024 file descriptors and that all
    of them are used. See <a href="#3">section 3</a> "Global parameters" to find how to tune the
    system.

  - "feconn" is the total number of concurrent connections on the frontend when
    the session was logged. It is useful to estimate the amount of resource
    required to sustain high loads, and to detect when the frontend's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>"
    has been reached. Most often when this value increases by huge jumps, it is
    because there is congestion on the backend servers, but sometimes it can be
    caused by a denial of service attack.

  - "beconn" is the total number of concurrent connections handled by the
    backend when the session was logged. It includes the total number of
    concurrent connections active on servers as well as the number of
    connections pending in queues. It is useful to estimate the amount of
    additional servers needed to support high loads for a given application.
    Most often when this value increases by huge jumps, it is because there is
    congestion on the backend servers, but sometimes it can be caused by a
    denial of service attack.

  - "<a href="#srv_conn">srv_conn</a>" is the total number of concurrent connections still active on
    the server when the session was logged. It can never exceed the server's
    configured "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter. If this value is very often close or equal
    to the server's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>", it means that traffic regulation is involved a
    lot, meaning that either the server's maxconn value is too low, or that
    there aren't enough servers to process the load with an optimal response
    time. When only one of the server's "<a href="#srv_conn">srv_conn</a>" is high, it usually means
    that this server has some trouble causing the requests to take longer to be
    processed than on other servers.

  - "<a href="#retries">retries</a>" is the number of connection retries experienced by this session
    when trying to connect to the server. It must normally be zero, unless a
    server is being stopped at the same moment the connection was attempted.
    Frequent retries generally indicate either a network problem between
    HAProxy and the server, or a misconfigured system backlog on the server
    preventing new connections from being queued. This field may optionally be
    prefixed with a '+' sign, indicating that the session has experienced a
    redispatch after the maximal retry count has been reached on the initial
    server. In this case, the server name appearing in the log is the one the
    connection was redispatched to, and not the first one, though both may
    sometimes be the same in case of hashing for instance. So as a general rule
    of thumb, when a '+' is present in front of the retry count, this count
    should not be attributed to the logged server.

  - "<span class="dropdown">srv_queue</span>" is the total number of requests which were processed before
    this one in the server queue. It is zero when the request has not gone
    through the server queue. It makes it possible to estimate the approximate
    server's response time by dividing the time spent in queue by the number of
    requests in the queue. It is worth noting that if a session experiences a
    redispatch and passes through two server queues, their positions will be
    cumulative. A request should not pass through both the server queue and the
    backend queue unless a redispatch occurs.

  - "backend_queue" is the total number of requests which were processed before
    this one in the backend's global queue. It is zero when the request has not
    gone through the global queue. It makes it possible to estimate the average
    queue length, which easily translates into a number of missing servers when
    divided by a server's "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter. It is worth noting that if a
    session experiences a redispatch, it may pass twice in the backend's queue,
    and then both positions will be cumulative. A request should not pass
    through both the server queue and the backend queue unless a redispatch
    occurs.

  - "captured_request_headers" is a list of headers captured in the request due
    to the presence of the "<a href="#capture%20request%20header">capture request header</a>" statement in the frontend.
    Multiple headers can be captured, they will be delimited by a vertical bar
    ('|'). When no capture is enabled, the braces do not appear, causing a
    shift of remaining fields. It is important to note that this field may
    contain spaces, and that using it requires a smarter log parser than when
    it's not used. Please consult the section "Capturing HTTP headers and
    cookies" below for more details.

  - "captured_response_headers" is a list of headers captured in the response
    due to the presence of the "<a href="#capture%20response%20header">capture response header</a>" statement in the
    frontend. Multiple headers can be captured, they will be delimited by a
    vertical bar ('|'). When no capture is enabled, the braces do not appear,
    causing a shift of remaining fields. It is important to note that this
    field may contain spaces, and that using it requires a smarter log parser
    than when it's not used. Please consult the section "Capturing HTTP headers
    and cookies" below for more details.

  - "http_request" is the complete HTTP request line, including the method,
    request and HTTP version string. Non-printable characters are encoded (see
    below the section "Non-printable characters"). This is always the last
    field, and it is always delimited by quotes and is the only one which can
    contain quotes. If new fields are added to the log format, they will be
    added before this field. This field might be truncated if the request is
    huge and does not fit in the standard syslog buffer (1024 characters). This
    is the reason why this field must always remain the last one.

<small>8.2.4.</small> Custom log format</h4> <div>
<pre class="text">The directive log-format allows you to customize the logs in http mode and tcp
mode. It takes a string as argument.

HAProxy understands some log format variables. % precedes log format variables.
Variables can take arguments using braces ('{}'), and multiple arguments are
separated by commas within the braces. Flags may be added or removed by
prefixing them with a '+' or '-' sign.

Special variable "%o" may be used to propagate its flags to all other
variables on the same format string. This is particularly handy with quoted
("Q") and escaped ("E") string formats.

If a variable is named between square brackets ('[' .. ']') then it is used
as a sample expression rule (see <a href="#7.3">section 7.3</a>). This it useful to add some
less common information such as the client's SSL certificate's DN, or to log
the key that would be used to store an entry into a stick table.

Note: spaces must be escaped. In configuration directives "<a href="#log-format">log-format</a>",
"<a href="#log-format-sd">log-format-sd</a>" and "<a href="#unique-id-format">unique-id-format</a>", spaces are considered as
delimiters and are merged. In order to emit a verbatim '%', it must be
preceded by another '%' resulting in '%%'.

Note: when using the RFC5424 syslog message format, the characters '"',
'\' and ']' inside PARAM-VALUE should be escaped with '\' as prefix (see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.3.3 for more details). In
such cases, the use of the flag "E" should be considered.

Flags are :
  * Q: quote a string
  * X: hexadecimal representation (IPs, Ports, %Ts, %rt, %pid)
  * E: escape characters '"', '\' and ']' in a string with '\' as prefix
       (intended purpose is for the RFC5424 structured-data log formats)

<small>8.2.5.</small> Error log format</h4> <div><pre class="text">When an incoming connection fails due to an SSL handshake or an invalid PROXY
protocol header, HAProxy will log the event using a shorter, fixed line format.
By default, logs are emitted at the LOG_INFO level, unless the option
"<a href="#option%20log-separate-errors">log-separate-errors</a>" is set in the backend, in which case the LOG_ERR level
will be used. Connections on which no data are exchanged (e.g. probes) are not
logged if the "<a href="#option%20dontlognull">dontlognull</a>" option is set.

The format looks like this :

    &gt;&gt;&gt; Dec  3 18:27:14 localhost \
          haproxy[6103]: 127.0.0.1:56059 [03/Dec/2012:17:35:10.380] frt/f1: \

failures.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-8.3">
<small>8.3.</small> Advanced logging options</h3> <div><pre class="text">Some advanced logging options are often looked for but are not easy to find out
just by looking at the various options. Here is an entry point for the few
options which can enable better logging. Please refer to the keywords reference
for more information about their usage.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-8.3.1">
<small>8.3.1.</small> Disabling logging of external tests</h4> <div><pre class="text">It is quite common to have some monitoring tools perform health checks on
HAProxy. Sometimes it will be a layer 3 load-balancer such as LVS or any
commercial load-balancer, and sometimes it will simply be a more complete
monitoring system such as Nagios. When the tests are very frequent, users often
ask how to disable logging for those checks. There are three possibilities :

  - if connections come from everywhere and are just TCP probes, it is often
    desired to simply disable logging of connections without data exchange, by
    setting "<a href="#option%20dontlognull">option dontlognull</a>" in the frontend. It also disables logging of
    port scans, which may or may not be desired.

  - it is possible to use the "http-request set-log-level silent" action using
    a variety of conditions (source networks, paths, user-agents, etc).

  - if the tests are performed on a known URI, use "<a href="#monitor-uri">monitor-uri</a>" to declare
    this URI as dedicated to monitoring. Any host sending this request will
    only get the result of a health-check, and the request will not be logged.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-8.3.2">
<small>8.3.2.</small> Logging before waiting for the session to terminate</h4> <div><pre class="text">The problem with logging at end of connection is that you have no clue about
what is happening during very long sessions, such as remote terminal sessions
or large file downloads. This problem can be worked around by specifying
"<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" in the frontend. HAProxy will then log as soon as possible,
just before data transfer begins. This means that in case of TCP, it will still
log the connection status to the server, and in case of HTTP, it will log just
after processing the server headers. In this case, the number of bytes reported
is the number of header bytes sent to the client. In order to avoid confusion
with normal logs, the total time field and the number of bytes are prefixed
with a '+' sign which means that real numbers are certainly larger.
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-8.3.3">
<small>8.3.3.</small> Raising log level upon errors</h4> <div><pre class="text">Sometimes it is more convenient to separate normal traffic from errors logs,
for instance in order to ease error monitoring from log files. When the option
"<a href="#option%20log-separate-errors">log-separate-errors</a>" is used, connections which experience errors, timeouts,
retries, redispatches or HTTP status codes 5xx will see their syslog level
raised from "info" to "err". This will help a syslog daemon store the log in
a separate file. It is very important to keep the errors in the normal traffic
file too, so that log ordering is not altered. You should also be careful if
you already have configured your syslog daemon to store all logs higher than
"notice" in an "admin" file, because the "err" level is higher than "notice".
</pre></div>  <h4 id="chapter-8.3.4">
<small>8.3.4.</small> Disabling logging of successful connections</h4> <div><pre class="text">Although this may sound strange at first, some large sites have to deal with
multiple thousands of logs per second and are experiencing difficulties keeping
them intact for a long time or detecting errors within them. If the option
"<a href="#option%20dontlog-normal">dontlog-normal</a>" is set on the frontend, all normal connections will not be
logged. In this regard, a normal connection is defined as one without any
error, timeout, retry nor redispatch. In HTTP, the status code is checked too,
and a response with a status 5xx is not considered normal and will be logged
too. Of course, doing is is really discouraged as it will remove most of the
useful information from the logs. Do this only if you have no other
alternative.
</pre></div>  <h3 id="chapter-8.4">
<small>8.4.</small> Timing events</h3> <div><pre class="text">Timers provide a great help in troubleshooting network problems. All values are
reported in milliseconds (ms). These timers should be used in conjunction with
the session termination flags. In TCP mode with "<a href="#option%20tcplog">option tcplog</a>" set on the
frontend, 3 control points are reported under the form "Tw/Tc/Tt", and in HTTP
mode, 5 control points are reported under the form "TR/Tw/Tc/Tr/Ta". In
addition, three other measures are provided, "Th", "Ti", and "Tq".

Timings events in HTTP mode:

  - Th: total time to accept tcp connection and execute handshakes for low level
    protocols. Currently, these protocols are proxy-protocol and SSL. This may
    only happen once during the whole connection's lifetime. A large time here
    may indicate that the client only pre-established the connection without
    speaking, that it is experiencing network issues preventing it from
    completing a handshake in a reasonable time (e.g. MTU issues), or that an
    SSL handshake was very expensive to compute. Please note that this time is
    reported only before the first request, so it is safe to average it over
    all request to calculate the amortized value. The second and subsequent
    request will always report zero here.

  - Ti: is the idle time before the HTTP request (HTTP mode only). This timer
    counts between the end of the handshakes and the first byte of the HTTP
    request. When dealing with a second request in keep-alive mode, it starts
    to count after the end of the transmission the previous response. When a
    multiplexed protocol such as HTTP/2 is used, it starts to count immediately
    after the previous request. Some browsers pre-establish connections to a
    server in order to reduce the latency of a future request, and keep them
    pending until they need it. This delay will be reported as the idle time. A
    value of -1 indicates that nothing was received on the connection.

  - TR: total time to get the client request (HTTP mode only). It's the time
    elapsed between the first bytes received and the moment the proxy received
    the empty line marking the end of the HTTP headers. The value "-1"
    indicates that the end of headers has never been seen. This happens when
    the client closes prematurely or times out. This time is usually very short
    since most requests fit in a single packet. A large time may indicate a
    request typed by hand during a test.

  - Tq: total time to get the client request from the accept date or since the
    emission of the last byte of the previous response (HTTP mode only). It's
    exactly equal to Th + Ti + TR unless any of them is -1, in which case it
    returns -1 as well. This timer used to be very useful before the arrival of
    HTTP keep-alive and browsers' pre-connect feature. It's recommended to drop
    it in favor of TR nowadays, as the idle time adds a lot of noise to the
    reports.

  - Tw: total time spent in the queues waiting for a connection slot. It
    accounts for backend queue as well as the server queues, and depends on the
    queue size, and the time needed for the server to complete previous
    requests. The value "-1" means that the request was killed before reaching
    the queue, which is generally what happens with invalid or denied requests.

  - Tc: total time to establish the TCP connection to the server. It's the time
    elapsed between the moment the proxy sent the connection request, and the
    moment it was acknowledged by the server, or between the TCP SYN packet and
    the matching SYN/ACK packet in return. The value "-1" means that the
    connection never established.

  - Tr: server response time (HTTP mode only). It's the time elapsed between
    the moment the TCP connection was established to the server and the moment
    the server sent its complete response headers. It purely shows its request
    processing time, without the network overhead due to the data transmission.
    It is worth noting that when the client has data to send to the server, for
    instance during a POST request, the time already runs, and this can distort
    apparent response time. For this reason, it's generally wise not to trust
    too much this field for POST requests initiated from clients behind an
    untrusted network. A value of "-1" here means that the last the response
    header (empty line) was never seen, most likely because the server timeout
    stroke before the server managed to process the request.

  - Ta: total active time for the HTTP request, between the moment the proxy
    received the first byte of the request header and the emission of the last
    byte of the response body. The exception is when the "<a href="#option%20logasap">logasap</a>" option is
    specified. In this case, it only equals (TR+Tw+Tc+Tr), and is prefixed with
    a '+' sign. From this field, we can deduce "Td", the data transmission time,
    by subtracting other timers when valid :

        Td = Ta - (TR + Tw + Tc + Tr)

    Timers with "-1" values have to be excluded from this equation. Note that
    "Ta" can never be negative.

  - Tt: total session duration time, between the moment the proxy accepted it
    and the moment both ends were closed. The exception is when the "<a href="#option%20logasap">logasap</a>"
    option is specified. In this case, it only equals (Th+Ti+TR+Tw+Tc+Tr), and
    is prefixed with a '+' sign. From this field, we can deduce "Td", the data
    transmission time, by subtracting other timers when valid :

        Td = Tt - (Th + Ti + TR + Tw + Tc + Tr)

    Timers with "-1" values have to be excluded from this equation. In TCP
    mode, "Ti", "Tq" and "Tr" have to be excluded too. Note that "Tt" can never
    be negative and that for HTTP, Tt is simply equal to (Th+Ti+Ta).

  - Tu: total estimated time as seen from client, between the moment the proxy
    accepted it and the moment both ends were closed, without idle time.
    This is useful to roughly measure end-to-end time as a user would see it,
    without idle time pollution from keep-alive time between requests. This
    timer in only an estimation of time seen by user as it assumes network
    latency is the same in both directions. The exception is when the "<a href="#option%20logasap">logasap</a>"
    option is specified. In this case, it only equals (Th+TR+Tw+Tc+Tr), and is
    prefixed with a '+' sign.

These timers provide precious indications on trouble causes. Since the TCP
protocol defines retransmit delays of 3, 6, 12... seconds, we know for sure
that timers close to multiples of 3s are nearly always related to lost packets
due to network problems (wires, negotiation, congestion). Moreover, if "Ta" or
"Tt" is close to a timeout value specified in the configuration, it often means
that a session has been aborted on timeout.

Most common cases :

  - If "Th" or "Ti" are close to 3000, a packet has probably been lost between
    the client and the proxy. This is very rare on local networks but might
    happen when clients are on far remote networks and send large requests. It
    may happen that values larger than usual appear here without any network
    cause. Sometimes, during an attack or just after a resource starvation has
    ended, HAProxy may accept thousands of connections in a few milliseconds.
    The time spent accepting these connections will inevitably slightly delay
    processing of other connections, and it can happen that request times in the
    order of a few tens of milliseconds are measured after a few thousands of
    new connections have been accepted at once. Using one of the keep-alive
    modes may display larger idle times since "Ti" measures the time spent
    waiting for additional requests.

  - If "Tc" is close to 3000, a packet has probably been lost between the
    server and the proxy during the server connection phase. This value should
    always be very low, such as 1 ms on local networks and less than a few tens
    of ms on remote networks.

  - If "Tr" is nearly always lower than 3000 except some rare values which seem
    to be the average majored by 3000, there are probably some packets lost
    between the proxy and the server.

  - If "Ta" is large even for small byte counts, it generally is because
    neither the client nor the server decides to close the connection while
    HAProxy is running in tunnel mode and both have agreed on a keep-alive
    connection mode. In order to solve this issue, it will be needed to specify
    one of the HTTP options to manipulate keep-alive or close options on either
    the frontend or the backend. Having the smallest possible 'Ta' or 'Tt' is
    important when connection regulation is used with the "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" option on
    the servers, since no new connection will be sent to the server until
    another one is released.

Other noticeable HTTP log cases ('xx' means any value to be ignored) :

  TR/Tw/Tc/Tr/+Ta  The "<a href="#option%20logasap">option logasap</a>" is present on the frontend and the log
                   was emitted before the data phase. All the timers are valid
                   except "Ta" which is shorter than reality.

  -1/xx/xx/xx/Ta   The client was not able to send a complete request in time
                   or it aborted too early. Check the session termination flags
                   then "<a href="#timeout%20http-request">timeout http-request</a>" and "<span class="dropdown">timeout client</span>" settings.

  TR/-1/xx/xx/Ta   It was not possible to process the request, maybe because
                   servers were out of order, because the request was invalid
                   or forbidden by ACL rules. Check the session termination
                   flags.

  TR/Tw/-1/xx/Ta   The connection could not establish on the server. Either it
                   actively refused it or it timed out after Ta-(TR+Tw) ms.
                   Check the session termination flags, then check the
                   "<span class="dropdown">timeout connect</span>" setting. Note that the tarpit action might
                   return similar-looking patterns, with "Tw" equal to the time
                   the client connection was maintained open.

  TR/Tw/Tc/-1/Ta   The server has accepted the connection but did not return
                   a complete response in time, or it closed its connection
                   unexpectedly after Ta-(TR+Tw+Tc) ms. Check the session
                   termination flags, then check the "<span class="dropdown">timeout server</span>" setting.

<small>8.5.</small> Session state at disconnection</h3> <div><pre class="text">TCP and HTTP logs provide a session termination indicator in the
"termination_state" field, just before the number of active connections. It is
2-characters long in TCP mode, and is extended to 4 characters in HTTP mode,
each of which has a special meaning :

  - On the first character, a code reporting the first event which caused the
    session to terminate :

        C : the TCP session was unexpectedly aborted by the client.

        S : the TCP session was unexpectedly aborted by the server, or the
            server explicitly refused it.

        P : the session was prematurely aborted by the proxy, because of a
            connection limit enforcement, because a DENY filter was matched,
            because of a security check which detected and blocked a dangerous
            error in server response which might have caused information leak
            (e.g. cacheable cookie).

        L : the session was locally processed by HAProxy and was not passed to
            a server. This is what happens for stats and redirects.

        R : a resource on the proxy has been exhausted (memory, sockets, source
            ports, ...). Usually, this appears during the connection phase, and
            system logs should contain a copy of the precise error. If this
            happens, it must be considered as a very serious anomaly which
            should be fixed as soon as possible by any means.

        I : an internal error was identified by the proxy during a self-check.
            This should NEVER happen, and you are encouraged to report any log
            containing this, because this would almost certainly be a bug. It
            would be wise to preventively restart the process after such an
            event too, in case it would be caused by memory corruption.

        D : the session was killed by HAProxy because the server was detected
            as down and was configured to kill all connections when going down.

        U : the session was killed by HAProxy on this backup server because an
            active server was detected as up and was configured to kill all
            backup connections when going up.

        K : the session was actively killed by an admin operating on HAProxy.

        c : the client-side timeout expired while waiting for the client to
            send or receive data.

        s : the server-side timeout expired while waiting for the server to
            send or receive data.

        - : normal session completion, both the client and the server closed
            with nothing left in the buffers.

  - on the second character, the TCP or HTTP session state when it was closed :

        R : the proxy was waiting for a complete, valid REQUEST from the client
            (HTTP mode only). Nothing was sent to any server.

        Q : the proxy was waiting in the QUEUE for a connection slot. This can
            only happen when servers have a 'maxconn' parameter set. It can
            also happen in the global queue after a redispatch consecutive to
            a failed attempt to connect to a dying server. If no redispatch is
            reported, then no connection attempt was made to any server.

        C : the proxy was waiting for the CONNECTION to establish on the
            server. The server might at most have noticed a connection attempt.

        H : the proxy was waiting for complete, valid response HEADERS from the
            server (HTTP only).

        D : the session was in the DATA phase.

        L : the proxy was still transmitting LAST data to the client while the
            server had already finished. This one is very rare as it can only
            happen when the client dies while receiving the last packets.

        T : the request was tarpitted. It has been held open with the client
            during the whole "<a href="#timeout%20tarpit">timeout tarpit</a>" duration or until the client
            closed, both of which will be reported in the "Tw" timer.

        - : normal session completion after end of data transfer.

  - the third character tells whether the persistence cookie was provided by
    the client (only in HTTP mode) :

        N : the client provided NO cookie. This is usually the case for new
            visitors, so counting the number of occurrences of this flag in the
            logs generally indicate a valid trend for the site frequentation.

        I : the client provided an INVALID cookie matching no known server.
            This might be caused by a recent configuration change, mixed
            cookies between HTTP/HTTPS sites, persistence conditionally
            ignored, or an attack.

        D : the client provided a cookie designating a server which was DOWN,
            so either "<a href="#option%20persist">option persist</a>" was used and the client was sent to
            this server, or it was not set and the client was redispatched to
            another server.

        V : the client provided a VALID cookie, and was sent to the associated
            server.

        E : the client provided a valid cookie, but with a last date which was
            older than what is allowed by the "maxidle" cookie parameter, so
            the cookie is consider EXPIRED and is ignored. The request will be
            redispatched just as if there was no cookie.

        O : the client provided a valid cookie, but with a first date which was
            older than what is allowed by the "maxlife" cookie parameter, so
            the cookie is consider too OLD and is ignored. The request will be
            redispatched just as if there was no cookie.

        U : a cookie was present but was not used to select the server because
            some other server selection mechanism was used instead (typically a
            "<a href="#use-server">use-server</a>" rule).

        - : does not apply (no cookie set in configuration).

  - the last character reports what operations were performed on the persistence
    cookie returned by the server (only in HTTP mode) :

        N : NO cookie was provided by the server, and none was inserted either.

        I : no cookie was provided by the server, and the proxy INSERTED one.
            Note that in "cookie insert" mode, if the server provides a cookie,
            it will still be overwritten and reported as "I" here.

        U : the proxy UPDATED the last date in the cookie that was presented by
            the client. This can only happen in insert mode with "maxidle". It
            happens every time there is activity at a different date than the
            date indicated in the cookie. If any other change happens, such as
            a redispatch, then the cookie will be marked as inserted instead.

        P : a cookie was PROVIDED by the server and transmitted as-is.

        R : the cookie provided by the server was REWRITTEN by the proxy, which
            happens in "cookie rewrite" or "cookie prefix" modes.

        D : the cookie provided by the server was DELETED by the proxy.

        - : does not apply (no cookie set in configuration).

The combination of the two first flags gives a lot of information about what
was happening when the session terminated, and why it did terminate. It can be
helpful to detect server saturation, network troubles, local system resource
starvation, attacks, etc...

The most common termination flags combinations are indicated below. They are
alphabetically sorted, with the lowercase set just after the upper case for
easier finding and understanding.

  Flags   Reason

     --   Normal termination.

     CC   The client aborted before the connection could be established to the
          server. This can happen when HAProxy tries to connect to a recently
          dead (or unchecked) server, and the client aborts while HAProxy is
          waiting for the server to respond or for "<span class="dropdown">timeout connect</span>" to expire.

     CD   The client unexpectedly aborted during data transfer. This can be
          caused by a browser crash, by an intermediate equipment between the
          client and HAProxy which decided to actively break the connection,
          by network routing issues between the client and HAProxy, or by a
          keep-alive session between the server and the client terminated first
          by the client.

     cD   The client did not send nor acknowledge any data for as long as the
          "<span class="dropdown">timeout client</span>" delay. This is often caused by network failures on
          the client side, or the client simply leaving the net uncleanly.

     CH   The client aborted while waiting for the server to start responding.
          It might be the server taking too long to respond or the client
          clicking the 'Stop' button too fast.

     cH   The "<span class="dropdown">timeout client</span>" stroke while waiting for client data during a
          POST request. This is sometimes caused by too large TCP MSS values
          for PPPoE networks which cannot transport full-sized packets. It can
          also happen when client timeout is smaller than server timeout and
          the server takes too long to respond.

     CQ   The client aborted while its session was queued, waiting for a server
          with enough empty slots to accept it. It might be that either all the
          servers were saturated or that the assigned server was taking too
          long a time to respond.

     CR   The client aborted before sending a full HTTP request. Most likely
          the request was typed by hand using a telnet client, and aborted
          too early. The HTTP status code is likely a 400 here. Sometimes this
          might also be caused by an IDS killing the connection between HAProxy
          and the client. "<a href="#option%20http-ignore-probes">option http-ignore-probes</a>" can be used to ignore
          connections without any data transfer.

     cR   The "<a href="#timeout%20http-request">timeout http-request</a>" stroke before the client sent a full HTTP
          request. This is sometimes caused by too large TCP MSS values on the
          client side for PPPoE networks which cannot transport full-sized
          packets, or by clients sending requests by hand and not typing fast
          enough, or forgetting to enter the empty line at the end of the
          request. The HTTP status code is likely a 408 here. Note: recently,
          some browsers started to implement a "pre-connect" feature consisting
          in speculatively connecting to some recently visited web sites just
          in case the user would like to visit them. This results in many
          connections being established to web sites, which end up in 408
          Request Timeout if the timeout strikes first, or 400 Bad Request when
          the browser decides to close them first. These ones pollute the log
          and feed the error counters. Some versions of some browsers have even
          been reported to display the error code. It is possible to work
          around the undesirable effects of this behavior by adding "option
          http-ignore-probes" in the frontend, resulting in connections with
          zero data transfer to be totally ignored. This will definitely hide
          the errors of people experiencing connectivity issues though.

     CT   The client aborted while its session was tarpitted. It is important to
          check if this happens on valid requests, in order to be sure that no
          wrong tarpit rules have been written. If a lot of them happen, it
          might make sense to lower the "<a href="#timeout%20tarpit">timeout tarpit</a>" value to something
          closer to the average reported "Tw" timer, in order not to consume
          resources for just a few attackers.

     LR   The request was intercepted and locally handled by HAProxy. Generally
          it means that this was a redirect or a stats request.

     SC   The server or an equipment between it and HAProxy explicitly refused
          the TCP connection (the proxy received a TCP RST or an ICMP message
          in return). Under some circumstances, it can also be the network
          stack telling the proxy that the server is unreachable (e.g. no route,
          or no ARP response on local network). When this happens in HTTP mode,
          the status code is likely a 502 or 503 here.

     sC   The "<span class="dropdown">timeout connect</span>" stroke before a connection to the server could
          complete. When this happens in HTTP mode, the status code is likely a
          503 or 504 here.

     SD   The connection to the server died with an error during the data
          transfer. This usually means that HAProxy has received an RST from
          the server or an ICMP message from an intermediate equipment while
          exchanging data with the server. This can be caused by a server crash
          or by a network issue on an intermediate equipment.

     sD   The server did not send nor acknowledge any data for as long as the
          "<span class="dropdown">timeout server</span>" setting during the data phase. This is often caused
          by too short timeouts on L4 equipment before the server (firewalls,
          load-balancers, ...), as well as keep-alive sessions maintained
          between the client and the server expiring first on HAProxy.

     SH   The server aborted before sending its full HTTP response headers, or
          it crashed while processing the request. Since a server aborting at
          this moment is very rare, it would be wise to inspect its logs to
          control whether it crashed and why. The logged request may indicate a
          small set of faulty requests, demonstrating bugs in the application.
          Sometimes this might also be caused by an IDS killing the connection
          between HAProxy and the server.

     sH   The "<span class="dropdown">timeout server</span>" stroke before the server could return its
          response headers. This is the most common anomaly, indicating too
          long transactions, probably caused by server or database saturation.
          The immediate workaround consists in increasing the "<span class="dropdown">timeout server</span>"
          setting, but it is important to keep in mind that the user experience
          will suffer from these long response times. The only long term
          solution is to fix the application.

     sQ   The session spent too much time in queue and has been expired. See
          the "<a href="#timeout%20queue">timeout queue</a>" and "<span class="dropdown">timeout connect</span>" settings to find out how to
          fix this if it happens too often. If it often happens massively in
          short periods, it may indicate general problems on the affected
          servers due to I/O or database congestion, or saturation caused by
          external attacks.

     PC   The proxy refused to establish a connection to the server because the
          process's socket limit has been reached while attempting to connect.
          The global "<span class="dropdown">maxconn</span>" parameter may be increased in the configuration
          so that it does not happen anymore. This status is very rare and
          might happen when the global "<a href="#ulimit-n">ulimit-n</a>" parameter is forced by hand.

     PD   The proxy blocked an incorrectly formatted chunked encoded message in
          a request or a response, after the server has emitted its headers. In
          most cases, this will indicate an invalid message from the server to
          the client. HAProxy supports chunk sizes of up to 2GB - 1 (2147483647
          bytes). Any larger size will be considered as an error.

     PH   The proxy blocked the server's response, because it was invalid,
          incomplete, dangerous (cache control), or matched a security filter.
          In any case, an HTTP 502 error is sent to the client. One possible
          cause for this error is an invalid syntax in an HTTP header name
          containing unauthorized characters. It is also possible but quite
          rare, that the proxy blocked a chunked-encoding request from the
          client due to an invalid syntax, before the server responded. In this
          case, an HTTP 400 error is sent to the client and reported in the
          logs.

     PR   The proxy blocked the client's HTTP request, either because of an
          invalid HTTP syntax, in which case it returned an HTTP 400 error to
          the client, or because a deny filter matched, in which case it
          returned an HTTP 403 error.

     PT   The proxy blocked the client's request and has tarpitted its
          connection before returning it a 500 server error. Nothing was sent
          to the server. The connection was maintained open for as long as
          reported by the "Tw" timer field.

     RC   A local resource has been exhausted (memory, sockets, source ports)
          preventing the connection to the server from establishing. The error
          logs will tell precisely what was missing. This is very rare and can
          only be solved by proper system tuning.

The combination of the two last flags gives a lot of information about how
persistence was handled by the client, the server and by HAProxy. This is very
important to troubleshoot disconnections, when users complain they have to
re-authenticate. The commonly encountered flags are :

     --   Persistence cookie is not enabled.

     NN   No cookie was provided by the client, none was inserted in the
          response. For instance, this can be in insert mode with "postonly"
          set on a GET request.

     II   A cookie designating an invalid server was provided by the client,
          a valid one was inserted in the response. This typically happens when
          a "<span class="dropdown">server</span>" entry is removed from the configuration, since its cookie
          value can be presented by a client when no other server knows it.

     NI   No cookie was provided by the client, one was inserted in the
          response. This typically happens for first requests from every user
          in "insert" mode, which makes it an easy way to count real users.

     VN   A cookie was provided by the client, none was inserted in the
          response. This happens for most responses for which the client has
          already got a cookie.

     VU   A cookie was provided by the client, with a last visit date which is
          not completely up-to-date, so an updated cookie was provided in
          response. This can also happen if there was no date at all, or if
          there was a date but the "maxidle" parameter was not set, so that the
          cookie can be switched to unlimited time.

     EI   A cookie was provided by the client, with a last visit date which is
          too old for the "maxidle" parameter, so the cookie was ignored and a
          new cookie was inserted in the response.

     OI   A cookie was provided by the client, with a first visit date which is
          too old for the "maxlife" parameter, so the cookie was ignored and a
          new cookie was inserted in the response.

     DI   The server designated by the cookie was down, a new server was
          selected and a new cookie was emitted in the response.

     VI   The server designated by the cookie was not marked dead but could not
          be reached. A redispatch happened and selected another one, which was
          then advertised in the response.

<small>8.6.</small> Non-printable characters</h3> <div><pre class="text">In order not to cause trouble to log analysis tools or terminals during log
consulting, non-printable characters are not sent as-is into log files, but are
converted to the two-digits hexadecimal representation of their ASCII code,
prefixed by the character '#'. The only characters that can be logged without
being escaped are comprised between 32 and 126 (inclusive). Obviously, the
escape character '#' itself is also encoded to avoid any ambiguity ("#23"). It
is the same for the character '"' which becomes "#22", as well as '{', '|' and
'}' when logging headers.

Note that the space character (' ') is not encoded in headers, which can cause
issues for tools relying on space count to locate fields. A typical header
containing spaces is "User-Agent".

Last, it has been observed that some syslog daemons such as syslog-ng escape
the quote ('"') with a backslash ('\'). The reverse operation can safely be
performed since no quote may appear anywhere else in the logs.

<small>8.7.</small> Capturing HTTP cookies</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">Cookie capture simplifies the tracking a complete user session. This can be
achieved using the "<a href="#capture%20cookie">capture cookie</a>" statement in the frontend. Please refer to
<a href="#4.2">section 4.2</a> for more details. Only one cookie can be captured, and the same
cookie will simultaneously be checked in the request ("Cookie:" header) and in
the response ("Set-Cookie:" header). The respective values will be reported in
the HTTP logs at the "captured_request_cookie" and "captured_response_cookie"
locations (see <a href="#8.2.3">section 8.2.3</a> about HTTP log format). When either cookie is
not seen, a dash ('-') replaces the value. This way, it's easy to detect when a
user switches to a new session for example, because the server will reassign it
a new cookie. It is also possible to detect if a server unexpectedly sets a
wrong cookie to a client, leading to session crossing.
</pre>
<div class="separator"> <span class="label label-success">Examples :</span> <pre class="prettyprint">
<code><span class="comment"># capture the first cookie whose name starts with "ASPSESSION"</span>
capture cookie ASPSESSION len 32

<span class="comment"># capture the first cookie whose name is exactly "vgnvisitor"</span>

</code></pre> </div>
</div>  <h3 id="chapter-8.8">
<small>8.8.</small> Capturing HTTP headers</h3> <div>
<pre class="text">Header captures are useful to track unique request identifiers set by an upper
proxy, virtual host names, user-agents, POST content-length, referrers, etc. In
the response, one can search for information about the response length, how the
server asked the cache to behave, or an object location during a redirection.

Header captures are performed using the "<a href="#capture%20request%20header">capture request header</a>" and "capture
response header" statements in the frontend. Please consult their definition in
<a href="#4.2">section 4.2</a> for more details.

It is possible to include both request headers and response headers at the same
time. Non-existent headers are logged as empty strings, and if one header
appears more than once, only its last occurrence will be logged. Request headers
are grouped within braces '{' and '}' in the same order as they were declared,
and delimited with a vertical bar '|' without any space. Response headers
follow the same representation, but are displayed after a space following the
request headers block. These blocks are displayed just before the HTTP request
in the logs.

As a special case, it is possible to specify an HTTP header capture in a TCP
frontend. The purpose is to enable logging of headers which will be parsed in
an HTTP backend if the request is then switched to this HTTP backend.

    =&gt; the proxy blocked a server response either because of an "http-response
       deny" rule, or because the response was improperly formatted and not
       HTTP-compliant, or because it blocked sensitive information which risked
       being cached. In this case, the response is replaced with a "502 bad
       gateway". The flags ("PH--") tell us that it was HAProxy who decided to
       return the 502 and not the server.

       time-out ("c---") after 50s, while the proxy was waiting for the request

<small>10.</small> FastCGI applications</h2> <div><pre class="text">HAProxy is able to send HTTP requests to Responder FastCGI applications. This
feature was added in HAProxy 2.1. To do so, servers must be configured to use
the FastCGI protocol (using the keyword "proto fcgi" on the server line) and a
FastCGI application must be configured and used by the backend managing these
servers (using the keyword "<span class="dropdown">use-fcgi-app</span>" into the proxy section). Several
FastCGI applications may be defined, but only one can be used at a time by a
backend.

HAProxy implements all features of the FastCGI specification for Responder
application. Especially it is able to multiplex several requests on a simple
connection.

to such limitation is because otherwise the matching always fails (due to a

<small>10.3.</small> Limitations</h3> <div><pre class="text">The current implementation have some limitations. The first one is about the
way some request headers are hidden to the FastCGI applications. This happens
during the headers analysis, on the backend side, before the connection
establishment. At this stage, HAProxy know the backend is using a FastCGI
application but it don't know if the request will be routed to a FastCGI server
or not. But to hide request headers, it simply removes them from the HTX
message. So, if the request is finally routed to an HTTP server, it never see
these headers. For this reason, it is not recommended to mix FastCGI servers
and HTTP servers under the same backend.

Similarly, the rules "<a href="#set-param">set-param</a>" and "<a href="#pass-header">pass-header</a>" are evaluated during the
request headers analysis. So the evaluation is always performed, even if the
requests is finally forwarded to an HTTP server.

About the rules "<a href="#set-param">set-param</a>", when a rule is applied, a pseudo header is added
into the HTX message. So, the same way than for HTTP header rewrites, it may
fail if the buffer is full. The rules "<a href="#set-param">set-param</a>" will compete with
"<span class="dropdown">http-request</span>" ones.

Finally, all FastCGI params and HTTP headers are sent into a unique record
FCGI_PARAM. Encoding of this record must be done in one pass, otherwise a
processing error is returned. It means the record FCGI_PARAM, once encoded,
must not exceeds the size of a buffer. However, there is no reserve to respect
here.
</pre></div>  <h2 id="chapter-11">
<small>11.</small> Address formats</h2> <div><pre class="text">Several statements as "bind, "<span class="dropdown">server</span>", "<a href="#nameserver">nameserver</a>" and "<span class="dropdown">log</span>" requires an
address.

This address can be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or '*'.
The '*' is equal to the special address "0.0.0.0" and can be used, in the case
of "<span class="dropdown">bind</span>" or "<a href="#dgram-bind">dgram-bind</a>" to listen on all IPv4 of the system.The IPv6
equivalent is '::'.

Depending of the statement, a port or port range follows the IP address. This
is mandatory on 'bind' statement, optional on 'server'.

This address can also begin with a slash '/'. It is considered as the "unix"
family, and '/' and following characters must be present the path.

Default socket type or transport method "datagram" or "stream" depends on the
configuration statement showing the address. Indeed, 'bind' and 'server' will
use a "stream" socket type by default whereas 'log', 'nameserver' or
'dgram-bind' will use a "datagram".

Optionally, a prefix could be used to force the address family and/or the
socket type and the transport method.

                               IPv6 address depending on the syntax. Depending
                               on the statement using this address, a port or
                               a port range may or must be specified.

'ipv4@&lt;address&gt;[:port1[-port2]]' following &lt;address&gt; is always considered as
                                 an IPv4 address. Depending on the statement
                                 using this address, a port or a port range
                                 may or must be specified.

'ipv6@&lt;address&gt;[:port1[-port2]]' following &lt;address&gt; is always considered as
                                 an IPv6 address. Depending on the statement
                                 using this address, a port or a port range
                                 may or must be specified.

'sockpair@&lt;n&gt;' following address is the file descriptor of a connected unix
               socket or of a socketpair. During a connection, the initiator
               creates a pair of connected sockets, and passes one of them
               over the FD to the other end. The listener waits to receive
               the FD from the unix socket and uses it as if it were the FD
               of an accept(). Should be used carefully.

'unix@&lt;path&gt;'  following string is considered as a UNIX socket &lt;path&gt;. this
               prefix is useful to declare an UNIX socket path which don't
               start by slash '/'.

<small>11.</small> 2 Socket type prefixes</h2> <div><pre class="text">Previous "Address family prefixes" can also be prefixed to force the socket
type and the transport method. The default depends of the statement using
this address but in some cases the user may force it to a different one.
This is the case for "<span class="dropdown">log</span>" statement where the default is syslog over UDP
but we could force to use syslog over TCP.

Those prefixes were designed for internal purpose and users should
instead use aliases of the next section "11.5.3 Protocol prefixes".

If users need one those prefixes to perform what they expect because
they can not configure the same using the protocol prefixes, they should
report this to the maintainers.

'stream+&lt;family&gt;@&lt;address&gt;' forces socket type and transport method
                            to "stream"

'dgram+&lt;family&gt;@&lt;address&gt;'  forces socket type and transport method
                            to "datagram".
