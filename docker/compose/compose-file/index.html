<h1>Compose specification</h1>

<p>The Compose file is a <a href="https://yaml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">YAML</a> file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the <a href="https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">Compose Specification</a>. The Compose spec merges the legacy 2.x and 3.x versions, aggregating properties across these formats and is implemented by <strong>Compose 1.27.0+</strong>.</p> <h2 id="status-of-this-document">Status of this document</h2> <p>This document specifies the Compose file format used to define multi-containers applications. Distribution of this document is unlimited.</p> <p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">RFC 2119</a>.</p> <h3 id="requirements-and-optional-attributes">Requirements and optional attributes</h3> <p>The Compose specification includes properties designed to target a local <a href="https://opencontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">OCI</a> container runtime, exposing Linux kernel specific configuration options, but also some Windows container specific properties, as well as cloud platform features related to resource placement on a cluster, replicated application distribution and scalability.</p> <p>We acknowledge that no Compose implementation is expected to support <strong>all</strong> attributes, and that support for some properties is Platform dependent and can only be confirmed at runtime. The definition of a versioned schema to control the supported properties in a Compose file, established by the <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">docker-compose</a> tool where the Compose file format was designed, doesn’t offer any guarantee to the end-user attributes will be actually implemented.</p> <p>The specification defines the expected configuration syntax and behavior, but - until noted - supporting any of those is OPTIONAL.</p> <p>A Compose implementation to parse a Compose file using unsupported attributes SHOULD warn user. We recommend implementors to support those running modes:</p> <ul> <li>default: warn user about unsupported attributes, but ignore them</li> <li>strict: warn user about unsupported attributes and reject the compose file</li> <li>loose: ignore unsupported attributes AND unknown attributes (that were not defined by the spec by the time implementation was created)</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-compose-application-model">The Compose application model</h2> <p>The Compose specification allows one to define a platform-agnostic container based application. Such an application is designed as a set of containers which have to both run together with adequate shared resources and communication channels.</p> <p>Computing components of an application are defined as <a href="#services-top-level-element">Services</a>. A Service is an abstract concept implemented on platforms by running the same container image (and configuration) one or more times.</p> <p>Services communicate with each other through <a href="#networks-top-level-element">Networks</a>. In this specification, a Network is a platform capability abstraction to establish an IP route between containers within services connected together. Low-level, platform-specific networking options are grouped into the Network definition and MAY be partially implemented on some platforms.</p> <p>Services store and share persistent data into <a href="#volumes-top-level-element">Volumes</a>. The specification describes such a persistent data as a high-level filesystem mount with global options. Actual platform-specific implementation details are grouped into the Volumes definition and MAY be partially implemented on some platforms.</p> <p>Some services require configuration data that is dependent on the runtime or platform. For this, the specification defines a dedicated concept: <a href="#configs-top-level-element">Configs</a>. From a Service container point of view, Configs are comparable to Volumes, in that they are files mounted into the container. But the actual definition involves distinct platform resources and services, which are abstracted by this type.</p> <p>A <a href="#secrets-top-level-element">Secret</a> is a specific flavor of configuration data for sensitive data that SHOULD NOT be exposed without security considerations. Secrets are made available to services as files mounted into their containers, but the platform-specific resources to provide sensitive data are specific enough to deserve a distinct concept and definition within the Compose specification.</p> <p>Distinction within Volumes, Configs and Secret allows implementations to offer a comparable abstraction at service level, but cover the specific configuration of adequate platform resources for well identified data usages.</p> <p>A <strong>Project</strong> is an individual deployment of an application specification on a platform. A project’s name is used to group resources together and isolate them from other applications or other installation of the same Compose specified application with distinct parameters. A Compose implementation creating resources on a platform MUST prefix resource names by project and set the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.docker.compose.project</code>.</p> <p>Project name can be set explicitly by top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attribute. Compose implementation MUST offer a way for user to set a custom project name and override this name, so that the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose.yaml</code> file can be deployed twice on the same infrastructure, without changes, by just passing a distinct name.</p> <h3 id="illustrative-example">Illustrative example</h3> <p>The following example illustrates Compose specification concepts with a concrete example application. The example is non-normative.</p> <p>Consider an application split into a frontend web application and a backend service.</p> <p>The frontend is configured at runtime with an HTTP configuration file managed by infrastructure, providing an external domain name, and an HTTPS server certificate injected by the platform’s secured secret store.</p> <p>The backend stores data in a persistent volume.</p> <p>Both services communicate with each other on an isolated back-tier network, while frontend is also connected to a front-tier network and exposes port 443 for external usage.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">(External user) --&gt; 443 [frontend network]

</pre></div> <p>The example application is composed of the following parts:</p> <ul> <li>2 services, backed by Docker images: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webapp</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">database</code>
</li> <li>1 secret (HTTPS certificate), injected into the frontend</li> <li>1 configuration (HTTP), injected into the frontend</li> <li>1 persistent volume, attached to the backend</li> <li>2 networks</li> </ul> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">services:
  frontend:
    image: awesome/webapp
    ports:
      - "443:8043"
    networks:
      - front-tier
      - back-tier

secrets:

    external: true

networks:
  # The presence of these objects is sufficient to define them
  front-tier: {}
  back-tier: {}
</pre></div> <p>This example illustrates the distinction between volumes, configs and secrets. While all of them are all exposed to service containers as mounted files or directories, only a volume can be configured for read+write access. Secrets and configs are read-only. The volume configuration allows you to select a volume driver and pass driver options to tweak volume management according to the actual infrastructure. Configs and Secrets rely on platform services, and are declared <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code> as they are not managed as part of the application lifecycle: the Compose implementation will use a platform-specific lookup mechanism to retrieve runtime values.</p> <h2 id="compose-file">Compose file</h2> <p>The Compose file is a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file defining <a href="#version-top-level-element">version</a> (DEPRECATED), <a href="#services-top-level-element">services</a> (REQUIRED), <a href="#networks-top-level-element">networks</a>, <a href="#volumes-top-level-element">volumes</a>, <a href="#configs-top-level-element">configs</a> and <a href="#secrets-top-level-element">secrets</a>. The default path for a Compose file is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose.yaml</code> (preferred) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose.yml</code> in working directory. Compose implementations SHOULD also support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yaml</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> for backward compatibility. If both files exist, Compose implementations MUST prefer canonical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose.yaml</code> one.</p> <p>Multiple Compose files can be combined together to define the application model. The combination of YAML files MUST be implemented by appending/overriding YAML elements based on Compose file order set by the user. Simple attributes and maps get overridden by the highest order Compose file, lists get merged by appending. Relative paths MUST be resolved based on the <strong>first</strong> Compose file’s parent folder, whenever complimentary files being merged are hosted in other folders.</p> <p>As some Compose file elements can both be expressed as single strings or complex objects, merges MUST apply to the expanded form.</p> <h3 id="profiles">Profiles</h3> <p>Profiles allow to adjust the Compose application model for various usages and environments. A Compose implementation SHOULD allow the user to define a set of active profiles. The exact mechanism is implementation specific and MAY include command line flags, environment variables, etc.</p> <p>The Services top-level element supports a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles</code> attribute to define a list of named profiles. Services without a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles</code> attribute set MUST always be enabled. A service MUST be ignored by the Compose implementation when none of the listed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles</code> match the active ones, unless the service is explicitly targeted by a command. In that case its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles</code> MUST be added to the set of active profiles. All other top-level elements are not affected by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles</code> and are always active.</p> <p>References to other services (by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">links</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extends</code> or shared resource syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service:xxx</code>) MUST not automatically enable a component that would otherwise have been ignored by active profiles. Instead the Compose implementation MUST return an error.</p> <h4 id="illustrative-example-1">Illustrative example</h4> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">services:

If some fields are unknown, typically because the Compose file was written with fields defined by a newer version of the specification, Compose implementations SHOULD warn the user.

Compose implementations MUST offer a way for user to override this name, and SHOULD define a mechanism to compute a default project name, to be used if the top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> element is not set.</p> <p>Whenever project name is defined by top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> or by some custom mechanism, it MUST be exposed for <a href="#interpolation">interpolation</a> and environment variable resolution as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME</code></p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">services:

</pre></div> <h2 id="services-top-level-element">Services top-level element</h2> <p>A Service is an abstract definition of a computing resource within an application which can be scaled/replaced independently from other components. Services are backed by a set of containers, run by the platform according to replication requirements and placement constraints. Being backed by containers, Services are defined by a Docker image and set of runtime arguments. All containers within a service are identically created with these arguments.</p> <p>A Compose file MUST declare a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">services</code> root element as a map whose keys are string representations of service names, and whose values are service definitions.

</pre></div> <p>Compose implementation MUST set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.docker.compose.project</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.docker.compose.volume</code> labels.</p> <h3 id="name-1">name</h3> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> set a custom name for this volume. The name field can be used to reference volumes that contain special characters. The name is used as is and will <strong>not</strong> be scoped with the stack name.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">volumes:
  data:
    name: "my-app-data"
</pre></div> <p>It can also be used in conjunction with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code> property. Doing so the name of the volume used to lookup for actual volume on platform is set separately from the name used to refer to it within the Compose file:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">volumes:
  db-data:
    external:
      name: actual-name-of-volume
</pre></div> <p>This make it possible to make this lookup name a parameter of a Compose file, so that the model ID for volume is hard-coded but the actual volume ID on platform is set at runtime during deployment:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">volumes:
  db-data:
    external:
      name: ${DATABASE_VOLUME}
</pre></div> <h2 id="configs-top-level-element">Configs top-level element</h2> <p>Configs allow services to adapt their behaviour without the need to rebuild a Docker image. Configs are comparable to Volumes from a service point of view as they are mounted into service’s containers filesystem. The actual implementation detail to get configuration provided by the platform can be set from the Configuration definition.</p> <p>When granted access to a config, the config content is mounted as a file in the container. The location of the mount point within the container defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/&lt;config-name&gt;</code> in Linux containers and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\&lt;config-name&gt;</code> in Windows containers.</p> <p>By default, the config MUST be owned by the user running the container command but can be overridden by service configuration. By default, the config MUST have world-readable permissions (mode 0444), unless service is configured to override this.</p> <p>Services can only access configs when explicitly granted by a <a href="#configs"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configs</code></a> subsection.</p> <p>The top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configs</code> declaration defines or references configuration data that can be granted to the services in this application. The source of the config is either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code>.</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code>: The config is created with the contents of the file at the specified path.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code>: If set to true, specifies that this config has already been created. Compose implementation does not attempt to create it, and if it does not exist, an error occurs.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>: The name of config object on Platform to lookup. This field can be used to reference configs that contain special characters. The name is used as is and will <strong>not</strong> be scoped with the project name.</li> </ul> <p>In this example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http_config</code> is created (as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;project_name&gt;_http_config</code>) when the application is deployed, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_second_config</code> MUST already exist on Platform and value will be obtained by lookup.</p> <p>In this example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server-http_config</code> is created as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;project_name&gt;_http_config</code> when the application is deployed, by registering content of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">httpd.conf</code> as configuration data.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">configs:
  http_config:
    file: ./httpd.conf
</pre></div> <p>Alternatively, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http_config</code> can be declared as external, doing so Compose implementation will lookup <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http_config</code> to expose configuration data to relevant services.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">configs:
  http_config:
    external: true
</pre></div> <p>External configs lookup can also use a distinct key by specifying a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>. The following example modifies the previous one to lookup for config using a parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP_CONFIG_KEY</code>. Doing so the actual lookup key will be set at deployment time by <a href="#interpolation">interpolation</a> of variables, but exposed to containers as hard-coded ID <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http_config</code>.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">configs:
  http_config:
    external: true
    name: "${HTTP_CONFIG_KEY}"
</pre></div> <p>Compose file need to explicitly grant access to the configs to relevant services in the application.</p> <h2 id="secrets-top-level-element">Secrets top-level element</h2> <p>Secrets are a flavour of Configs focussing on sensitive data, with specific constraint for this usage. As the platform implementation may significantly differ from Configs, dedicated Secrets section allows to configure the related resources.</p> <p>The top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secrets</code> declaration defines or references sensitive data that can be granted to the services in this application. The source of the secret is either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code>.</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code>: The secret is created with the contents of the file at the specified path.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">external</code>: If set to true, specifies that this secret has already been created. Compose implementation does not attempt to create it, and if it does not exist, an error occurs.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>: The name of the secret object in Docker. This field can be used to reference secrets that contain special characters. The name is used as is and will <strong>not</strong> be scoped with the project name.</li> </ul> <p>In this example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server-certificate</code> is created as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;project_name&gt;_server-certificate</code> when the application is deployed, by registering content of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server.cert</code> as a platform secret.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">secrets:
  server-certificate:
    file: ./server.cert
</pre></div> <p>Alternatively, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server-certificate</code> can be declared as external, doing so Compose implementation will lookup <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server-certificate</code> to expose secret to relevant services.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">secrets:
  server-certificate:
    external: true
</pre></div> <p>External secrets lookup can also use a distinct key by specifying a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>. The following example modifies the previous one to look up for secret using a parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CERTIFICATE_KEY</code>. Doing so the actual lookup key will be set at deployment time by <a href="#interpolation">interpolation</a> of variables, but exposed to containers as hard-coded ID <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server-certificate</code>.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">secrets:
  server-certificate:
    external: true
    name: "${CERTIFICATE_KEY}"
</pre></div> <p>Compose file need to explicitly grant access to the secrets to relevant services in the application.</p> <h2 id="fragments">Fragments</h2> <p>It is possible to re-use configuration fragments using <a href="http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2765878">YAML anchors</a>.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">volumes:
  db-data: &amp;default-volume
    driver: default
  metrics: *default-volume
</pre></div> <p>In previous sample, an <em>anchor</em> is created as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default-volume</code> based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db-data</code> volume specification. It is later reused by <em>alias</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*default-volume</code> to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metrics</code> volume. Same logic can apply to any element in a Compose file. Anchor resolution MUST take place before <a href="#interpolation">variables interpolation</a>, so variables can’t be used to set anchors or aliases.</p> <p>It is also possible to partially override values set by anchor reference using the <a href="http://yaml.org/type/merge.html">YAML merge type</a>. In following example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metrics</code> volume specification uses alias to avoid repetition but override <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attribute:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">
services:
  backend:
    image: awesome/database
    volumes:
      - db-data
      - metrics
volumes:
  db-data: &amp;default-volume
    driver: default
    name: "data"
  metrics:
    &lt;&lt;: *default-volume
    name: "metrics"
</pre></div> <h2 id="extension">Extension</h2> <p>Special extension fields can be of any format as long as their name starts with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x-</code> character sequence. They can be used within any structure in a Compose file. This is the sole exception for Compose implementations to silently ignore unrecognized field.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">x-custom:
  foo:
    - bar
    - zot

services:
  webapp:
    image: awesome/webapp
    x-foo: bar
</pre></div> <p>The contents of such fields are unspecified by Compose specification, and can be used to enable custom features. Compose implementation to encounter an unknown extension field MUST NOT fail, but COULD warn about unknown field.</p> <p>For platform extensions, it is highly recommended to prefix extension by platform/vendor name, the same way browsers add support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/syndata.html#vendor-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">custom CSS features</a>.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">service:

</pre></div> <h2 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h2> <p>Values in a Compose file can be set by variables, and interpolated at runtime. Compose files use a Bash-like syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE}</code></p> <p>Both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$VARIABLE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE}</code> syntax are supported. Default values can be defined inline using typical shell syntax: latest</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE:-default}</code> evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE</code> is unset or empty in the environment.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE-default}</code> evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default</code> only if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE</code> is unset in the environment.</li> </ul> <p>Similarly, the following syntax allows you to specify mandatory variables:</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE:?err}</code> exits with an error message containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">err</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE</code> is unset or empty in the environment.</li> <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE?err}</code> exits with an error message containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">err</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE</code> is unset in the environment.</li> </ul> <p>Interpolation can also be nested:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE:-${FOO}}</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE?$FOO}</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE:-${FOO:-default}}</code></li> </ul> <p>Other extended shell-style features, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${VARIABLE/foo/bar}</code>, are not supported by the Compose specification.</p> <p>You can use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> (double-dollar sign) when your configuration needs a literal dollar sign. This also prevents Compose from interpolating a value, so a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> allows you to refer to environment variables that you don’t want processed by Compose.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight" data-language="">web:

</pre></div> <p>If the Compose implementation can’t resolve a substituted variable and no default value is defined, it MUST warn the user and substitute the variable with an empty string.</p> <p>As any values in a Compose file can be interpolated with variable substitution, including compact string notation for complex elements, interpolation MUST be applied <em>before</em> merge on a per-file-basis.</p> <h2 id="compose-documentation">Compose documentation</h2> <ul> <li><a href="../index">User guide</a></li> <li><a href="../install/index">Installing Compose</a></li> <li><a href="compose-versioning/index">Compose file versions and upgrading</a></li> <li><a href="../samples-for-compose/index">Sample apps with Compose</a></li> <li><a href="../gpu-support/index">Enabling GPU access with Compose</a></li> <li><a href="../reference/index">Command line reference</a></li> </ul>
