<p>Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system, including quarter-of-year and week-based-year. </p>
<p> This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system. </p>
<h2>Quarter of year</h2> The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year. This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. <p> January, February and March are in Q1. April, May and June are in Q2. July, August and September are in Q3. October, November and December are in Q4. </p>
<p> The complete date is expressed using three fields: </p>
<ul> <li>
<a href="#DAY_OF_QUARTER"><code>DAY_OF_QUARTER</code></a> - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 </li>
<li>
<a href="#QUARTER_OF_YEAR"><code>QUARTER_OF_YEAR</code></a> - the quarter within the year, from 1 to 4 </li>
<li>
<a href="chronofield#YEAR"><code>YEAR</code></a> - the standard ISO year </li>
</ul> <h2>Week based years</h2> The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format, defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year. <p> The date is expressed using three fields: </p>
<ul> <li>
<a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_WEEK"><code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code></a> - the standard field defining the day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7) </li>
<li>
<a href="#WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR"><code>WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR</code></a> - the week within the week-based-year </li>
<li>
<a href="#WEEK_BASED_YEAR"><code>WEEK_BASED_YEAR</code></a> - the week-based-year </li>
</ul> The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year. It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday. <p> The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year. </p>
<ul> <li>If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st </li>
<li>If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year </li>
<li>If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year </li>
<li>If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year </li>
<li>If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th </li>
<li>If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd </li>
<li>If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd </li>
</ul> There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks. <p> For example: </p>

<p>The field that represents the day-of-quarter. </p>
<p> This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set. The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91 in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4. </p>
<p> The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year are available. </p>
<p> When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and potentially day 91, is in the following quarter. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year, quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#SMART">smart mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days, then the resulting date is two days later. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, only the year is validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one, and add the amount in days to the date. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>    <h3>QUARTER_OF_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalField QUARTER_OF_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The field that represents the quarter-of-year. </p>
<p> This field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set. The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4. </p>
<p> The quarter-of-year can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year, quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter. See <a href="#DAY_OF_QUARTER"><code>DAY_OF_QUARTER</code></a> for details. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>    <h3>WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalField WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year. </p>
<p> This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set. The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the week-based-year has 53 weeks. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#SMART">smart mode</a>, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year. If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has 52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, only the week-based-year is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year value is outside the range 1 to 52, then any excess weeks are added or subtracted from the resulting date. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>    <h3>WEEK_BASED_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalField WEEK_BASED_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The field that represents the week-based-year. </p>
<p> This field allows the week-based-year value to be queried and set. </p>
<p> The field has a range that matches <a href="../localdate#MAX"><code>LocalDate.MAX</code></a> and <a href="../localdate#MIN"><code>LocalDate.MIN</code></a>. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week. See <a href="#WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR"><code>WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR</code></a> for details. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>    <h3>WEEK_BASED_YEARS</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalUnit WEEK_BASED_YEARS</pre> <div>
<p>The unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction. </p>
<p> This allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date. The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks. The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO year at <code>365.2425 Days</code>. </p>
<p> The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value for the week-based-year field. If the resulting week-based-year only has 52 weeks, then the date will be in week 1 of the following week-based-year. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>    <h3>QUARTER_YEARS</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalUnit QUARTER_YEARS</pre> <div>
<p>Unit that represents the concept of a quarter-year. For the ISO calendar system, it is equal to 3 months. The estimated duration of a quarter-year is one quarter of <code>365.2425 Days</code>. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
