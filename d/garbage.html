Usually it is not necessary to free memory explicitly. Just allocate as needed, and the garbage collector will periodically return all unused memory to the pool of available memory. </p>  <p>D also provides the mechanisms to write code where the garbage collector is <b>not involved</b>. More information is provided below. </p>  <p>Programmers accustomed to explicitly managing memory allocation and deallocation will likely be skeptical of the benefits and efficacy of garbage collection. Experience both with new projects written with garbage collection in mind, and converting existing projects to garbage collection shows that: </p>  <ul> <li>Garbage collected programs are often faster. This is counterintuitive, but the reasons are:  <ul> <li>Reference counting is a common solution to solve explicit memory allocation problems. The code to implement the increment and decrement operations whenever assignments are made is one source of slowdown. Hiding it behind smart pointer classes doesn't help the speed. (Reference counting methods are not a general solution anyway, as circular references never get deleted.) </li>  <li>Destructors are used to deallocate resources acquired by an object. For most classes, this resource is allocated memory. With garbage collection, most destructors then become empty and can be discarded entirely. </li>  <li>All those destructors freeing memory can become significant when objects are allocated on the stack. For each one, some mechanism must be established so that if an exception happens, the destructors all get called in each frame to release any memory they hold. If the destructors become irrelevant, then there's no need to set up special stack frames to handle exceptions, and the code runs faster. </li>  <li>Garbage collection kicks in only when memory gets tight. When memory is not tight, the program runs at full speed and does not spend any time tracing and freeing memory. </li>  <li>Garbage collected programs do not suffer from gradual deterioration due to an accumulation of memory leaks. </li> </ul> </li>  <li>Garbage collectors reclaim unused memory, therefore they do not suffer from "memory leaks" which can cause long running applications to gradually consume more and more memory until they bring down the system. GC programs have longer term stability. </li>  <li>Garbage collected programs have fewer hard-to-find pointer bugs. This is because there are no dangling references to freed memory. There is no code to explicitly manage memory, hence no bugs in such code. </li>  <li>Garbage collected programs are faster to develop and debug, because there's no need for developing, debugging, testing, or maintaining the explicit deallocation code. </li>  </ul>  <p>Garbage collection is not a panacea. There are some downsides: </p>  <ul> <li>It is not always obvious when the GC allocates memory, which in turn can trigger a collection, so the program can pause unexpectedly. </li>  <li>The time it takes for a collection to complete is not bounded. While in practice it is very quick, this cannot normally be guaranteed. </li>  <li>Normally, all threads other than the collector thread must be halted while the collection is in progress. </li>  <li>Garbage collectors can keep around some memory that an explicit deallocator would not. </li>  <li>Garbage collection should be implemented as a basic operating system kernel service. But since it is not, garbage collecting programs must carry around with them the garbage collection implementation. While this can be a shared library, it is still there. </li> </ul>  <p>These constraints are addressed by techniques outlined in <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Memory_Management">Memory Management</a>, including the mechanisms provided by D to control allocations outside the GC heap. </p>  <p>There is currently work in progress to make the runtime library free of GC heap allocations, to allow its use in scenarios where the use of GC infrastructure is not possible. </p>  <h2 id="how_gc_works">How Garbage Collection Works</h2>  <p>The GC works by:</p>  <ol> <li>Stopping all other threads than the thread currently trying to allocate GC memory.</li>  <li>‘Hijacking’ the current thread for GC work.</li>  <li>Scanning all ‘root’ memory ranges for pointers into GC allocated memory.</li>  <li>Recursively scanning all allocated memory pointed to by roots looking for more pointers into GC allocated memory.</li>  <li>Freeing all GC allocated memory that has no active pointers to it and do not need destructors to run.</li>  <li>Queueing all unreachable memory that needs destructors to run.</li>  <li>Resuming all other threads.</li>  <li>Running destructors for all queued memory.</li>  <li>Freeing any remaining unreachable memory.</li>  <li>Returning the current thread to whatever work it was doing.</li> </ol>  <h2 id="gc_foreign_obj">Interfacing Garbage Collected Objects With Foreign Code</h2>  <p>The garbage collector looks for roots in:</p> <ol> <li>the static data segment</li> <li>the stacks and register contents of each thread</li> <li>the TLS (thread-local storage) areas of each thread</li> <li>any roots added by core.memory.GC.addRoot() or core.memory.GC.addRange()</li> </ol>  <p>If the only pointer to an object is held outside of these areas, then the collector will miss it and free the memory. </p>  <p>To avoid this from happening, either</p>  <ul> <li>maintain a pointer to the object in an area the collector does scan for pointers;</li>  <li>add a root where a pointer to the object is stored using core.memory.GC.addRoot() or core.memory.GC.addRange().</li>  <li>reallocate and copy the object using the foreign code's storage allocator or using the C runtime library's malloc/free. </li> </ul>  <h2 id="pointers_and_gc">Pointers and the Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>Pointers in D can be broadly divided into two categories: Those that point to garbage collected memory, and those that do not. Examples of the latter are pointers created by calls to C's malloc(), pointers received from C library routines, pointers to static data, pointers to objects on the stack, etc. For those pointers, anything that is legal in C can be done with them. </p>  <p>For garbage collected pointers and references, however, there are some restrictions. These restrictions are minor, but they are intended to enable the maximum flexibility in garbage collector design. </p>  <b>Undefined Behavior</b>:  <ul> <li>Do not xor pointers with other values, like the xor pointer linked list trick used in C. </li>  <li>Do not use the xor trick to swap two pointer values. </li>  <li>Do not store pointers into non-pointer variables using casts and other tricks.  <pre data-language="d">void* p;
...
int x = cast(int)p;   // error: undefined behavior
</pre>  The garbage collector does not scan non-pointer fields for GC pointers. </li>  <li>Do not take advantage of alignment of pointers to store bit flags in the low order bits:  <pre data-language="d">p = cast(void*)(cast(int)p | 1);  // error: undefined behavior
</pre> </li>  <li>Do not store into pointers values that may point into the garbage collected heap:  <pre data-language="d">p = cast(void*)12345678;   // error: undefined behavior
</pre>  A copying garbage collector may change this value. </li>  <li>Do not store magic values into pointers, other than <code>null</code>. </li>  <li>Do not write pointer values out to disk and read them back in again. </li>  <li>Do not use pointer values to compute a hash function. A copying garbage collector can arbitrarily move objects around in memory, thus invalidating the computed hash value. </li>  <li>Do not depend on the ordering of pointers:  <pre data-language="d">if (p1 &lt; p2)  // error: undefined behavior
    ...
</pre> since, again, the garbage collector can move objects around in memory. </li>  <li>Do not add or subtract an offset to a pointer such that the result points outside of the bounds of the garbage collected object originally allocated.  <pre data-language="d">char* p = new char[10];
char* q = p + 6; // ok
q = p + 11;      // error: undefined behavior
q = p - 1;       // error: undefined behavior
</pre> </li>  <li>Do not misalign pointers if those pointers may point into the GC heap, such as:  <pre data-language="d">struct Foo
{
  align (1):
    byte b;
    char* p;  // misaligned pointer
}
</pre>  Misaligned pointers may be used if the underlying hardware supports them <b>and</b> the pointer is never used to point into the GC heap. </li>  <li>Do not use byte-by-byte memory copies to copy pointer values. This may result in intermediate conditions where there is not a valid pointer, and if the gc pauses the thread in such a condition, it can corrupt memory. Most implementations of <code>memcpy()</code> will work since the internal implementation of it does the copy in aligned chunks greater than or equal to the pointer size, but since this kind of implementation is not guaranteed by the C standard, use <code>memcpy()</code> only with extreme caution. </li>  <li>Do not have pointers in a struct instance that point back to the same instance. The trouble with this is if the instance gets moved in memory, the pointer will point back to where it came from, with likely disastrous results. </li>  </ul>   <p>Things that are reliable and can be done:</p>  <ul> <li>Use a union to share storage with a pointer:  <pre data-language="d">union U { void* ptr; int value }
</pre> </li>  <li>A pointer to the start of a garbage collected object need not be maintained if a pointer to the interior of the object exists.  <pre data-language="d">char[] p = new char[10];
char[] q = p[3..6];
// q is enough to hold on to the object, don't need to keep
// p as well.
</pre> </li> </ul>  <p>One can avoid using pointers anyway for most tasks. D provides features rendering most explicit pointer uses obsolete, such as reference objects, dynamic arrays, and garbage collection. Pointers are provided in order to interface successfully with C APIs and for some low level work. </p>  <h2 id="working_with_the_gc">Working with the Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>Garbage collection doesn't solve every memory deallocation problem. For example, if a pointer to a large data structure is kept, the garbage collector cannot reclaim it, even if it is never referred to again. To eliminate this problem, it is good practice to set a reference or pointer to an object to null when no longer needed. </p>  <p>This advice applies only to static references or references embedded inside other objects. There is not much point for such stored on the stack to be nulled because new stack frames are initialized anyway. </p>  <h2 id="obj_pinning_and_gc">Object Pinning and a Moving Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>Although D does not currently use a moving garbage collector, by following the rules listed above one can be implemented. No special action is required to pin objects. A moving collector will only move objects for which there are no ambiguous references, and for which it can update those references. All other objects will be automatically pinned. </p>  <h2 id="op_involving_gc">D Operations That Involve the Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>Some sections of code may need to avoid using the garbage collector. The following constructs may allocate memory using the garbage collector: </p>  <ul> <li><a href="expression#NewExpression"><i>NewExpression</i></a></li> <li>Array appending</li> <li>Array concatenation</li> <li>Array literals (except when used to initialize static data)</li> <li>Associative array literals</li> <li>Any insertion, removal, or lookups in an associative array</li> <li>Extracting keys or values from an associative array</li> <li>Taking the address of (i.e. making a delegate to) a nested function that accesses variables in an outer scope</li> <li>A function literal that accesses variables in an outer scope</li>  <li>An <a href="expression#AssertExpression"><i>AssertExpression</i></a> that fails its condition</li> </ul>  <h2 id="gc_config">Configuring the Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>Since version 2.067, The garbage collector can now be configured through the command line, the environment or by options embedded into the executable. </p>  <p>By default, GC options can only be passed on the command line of the program to run, e.g.</p>  <pre data-language="d">app "--DRT-gcopt=profile:1 minPoolSize:16" arguments to app
</pre>  <p>Available GC options are:</p> <ul> <li>disable:0|1 - start disabled</li> <li>profile:0|1 - enable profiling with summary when terminating program</li> <li>gc:conservative|precise|manual - select gc implementation (default = conservative)</li> <li>initReserve:N - initial memory to reserve in MB</li> <li>minPoolSize:N - initial and minimum pool size in MB</li> <li>maxPoolSize:N - maximum pool size in MB</li> <li>incPoolSize:N - pool size increment MB</li> <li>parallel:N - number of additional threads for marking</li> <li>heapSizeFactor:N - targeted heap size to used memory ratio</li> <li>cleanup:none|collect|finalize - how to treat live objects when terminating <ul> <li>collect: run a collection (the default for backward compatibility)</li> <li>none: do nothing</li> <li>finalize: all live objects are finalized unconditionally</li> </ul> </li>
</ul>   <p>In addition, --DRT-gcopt=help will show the list of options and their current settings. </p> <p>Command line options starting with "--DRT-" are filtered out before calling main, so the program will not see them. They are still available via <code>rt_args</code>. </p> <p>Configuration via the command line can be disabled by declaring a variable for the linker to pick up before using its default from the runtime:</p> <pre data-language="d">extern(C) __gshared bool rt_cmdline_enabled = false;
</pre>  <p>Likewise, declare a boolean <code>rt_envvars_enabled</code> to enable configuration via the environment variable <code>DRT_GCOPT</code>:</p> <pre data-language="d">extern(C) __gshared bool rt_envvars_enabled = true;
</pre>  <p>Setting default configuration properties in the executable can be done by specifying an array of options named <code>rt_options</code>:</p> <pre data-language="d">extern(C) __gshared string[] rt_options = [ "gcopt=initReserve:100 profile:1" ];
</pre>  <p>Evaluation order of options is <code>rt_options</code>, then environment variables, then command line arguments, i.e. if command line arguments are not disabled, they can override options specified through the environment or embedded in the executable. </p>  <h2 id="precise_gc">Precise Heap Scanning</h2>  <p>If you select <code>precise</code> as the garbage collector via the options above, type information will be used to identify actual or possible pointers or references within heap allocated data objects. Non-pointer data will not be interpreted as a reference to other memory as a "false pointer". The collector has to make pessimistic assumptions if a memory slot can contain both a pointer or an integer value, it will still be scanned (e.g. in a <code>union</code>). </p>  <p>If you use the GC memory functions from <code>core.memory</code>, and plan to use it for data with a mixture of pointers and non-pointer data you should pass the TypeInfo of your allocated struct, class or type as the optional parameter. The default <code>null</code> is interpreted as memory that might contain pointers everywhere.</p> <pre data-language="d">struct S { size_t hash; Data* data; }
S* s = cast(S*)GC.malloc(S.sizeof, 0, typeid(S));
</pre>  <p><span class="red">Attention:</span> Enabling precise scanning needs slightly more caution with type declarations. For example, if you reserve a buffer as part of a struct and later emplace an object instance with references to other allocations into this memory, you must not use basic integer types to reserve the space. Doing so will cause the garbage collector not to detect the references. Instead, use an array type that will scan this area conservatively. Using <code>void*</code> is usually the best option as it also ensures proper alignment for pointers being scanned by the GC. </p>  <h2 id="precise_dataseg">Precise Scanning of the DATA and TLS segment</h2>  <p><b>Windows only:</b> As of version 2.075, the DATA (global shared data) and TLS segment (thread local data) of an executable or DLL can be configured to be scanned precisely by the garbage collector instead of conservatively. This takes advantage of information emitted by the compiler to identify possible mutable pointers inside these segments. Immutable pointers <a href="const3#immutable_storage_class">with initializers</a> are excluded from scanning, too, as they can only point to preallocated memory. </p>  <p>Precise scanning can be enabled with the D runtime option "scanDataSeg". Possible option values are "conservative" (default) and "precise". As with the GC options, it can be specified on the command line, in the environment or embedded into the executable, e.g.</p> <pre data-language="d">extern(C) __gshared string[] rt_options = [ "scanDataSeg=precise" ];
</pre>   <p><span class="red">Attention:</span> Enabling precise scanning needs slightly more caution typing global memory. For example, if you pre-allocate memory in the DATA/TLS segment and later emplace an object instance with references to other allocations into this memory, you must not use basic integer types to reserve the space. Doing so will cause the garbage collector not to detect the references. Instead, use an array type that will scan this area conservatively. Using <code>void*</code> is usually the best option as it also ensures proper alignment for pointers being scanned by the GC.</p> <pre data-language="d">class Singleton { void[] mem; }
void*[(__traits(classInstanceSize, Singleton) - 1) / (void*).sizeof + 1]
    singleton_store;
static this()
{
    emplace!Singleton(singleton_store).mem = allocateMem();
}
Singleton singleton() { return cast(Singleton)singleton_store.ptr; }
</pre> For precise typing of that area, you can also let the compiler generate the class instance into the DATA segment for you: <pre data-language="d">class Singleton { void[] mem; }
shared(Singleton) singleton = new Singleton;
shared static this() { singleton.mem = allocateSharedMem(); }
</pre> This doesn't work for TLS memory, though.  <h2 id="gc_parallel">Parallel marking</h2>  <p>By default the garbage collector uses all available CPU cores to mark the heap.</p>  <p>This might affect your application if it has threads that are not suspended during the mark phase of the collection. You can configure the number of additional threads used for marking by GC option <code>parallel</code>, e.g. by passing <code>--DRT-gcopt=parallel:2</code> on the command line or embedding the option into the binary via <code>rt_options</code>. The number of threads actually created is limited to <a href="https://dlang.org/library/core/cpuid/threads_per_cpu.html"><code>core.cpuid.threadsPerCPU-1</code></a>. A value of <code>0</code> disables parallel marking completely.</p>  <h2 id="gc_registry">Adding your own Garbage Collector</h2>  <p>GC implementations are added to a registry that allows to supply more implementations by just linking them into the binary. To do so add a function that is executed before the D runtime initialization using <code>pragma(crt_constructor)</code>:</p> <pre data-language="d">import core.gc.gcinterface, core.gc.registry;
extern (C) pragma(crt_constructor) void registerMyGC()
{
    registerGCFactory("mygc", &amp;createMyGC);
}

GC createMyGC()
{
    __gshared instance = new MyGC;
    instance.initialize();
    return instance;
}

class MyGC : GC { /*...*/ }
</pre>  <p>[The GC modules defining the interface (gc.interface) and registration (gc.registry) are currently not public and are subject to change from version to version. Add an import search path to the druntime/src path to compile the example.]</p>  <p>The new GC is added to the list of available garbage collectors that can be selected via the usual configuration options, e.g. by embedding <code>rt_options</code> into the binary:</p> <pre data-language="d">extern (C) __gshared string[] rt_options = ["gcopt=gc:mygc"];
</pre>  <p>You can also remove the standard GC implementation from a statically linked binary by redefining the function <code>extern(C) void* register_default_gcs()</code>. If no custom garbage collector has been registered all attempts to allocate GC managed memory will terminate the application with an appropriate message.</p>  <h2 id="references">References</h2>  <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">Wikipedia</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-faq.html">GC FAQ</a></li> <li><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/gcsurvey.ps">Uniprocessor Garbage Collector Techniques</a></li> <li><a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471941484/classicempire">Garbage Collection: Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management</a></li> </ul>     <div class="_attribution">
