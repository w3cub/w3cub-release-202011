<h1>Preparing for ColumnStore Installation - 1.1.X</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3> <div class="cstm-style redbox">
<p>With the 1.1.X version of MariaDB ColumnStore, there should be no versions of MariaDB Server or MySQL pre-installed on the OS before a MariaDB ColumnStore binary or RPM is installed on the system. If you have an installation of MariaDB server, uninstall it before proceeding.</p> </div> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="configuration-preparation">Configuration preparation</h4> <p>Before installing MariaDB ColumnStore, there is some preparation necessary. You will need to determine the following, refer the MariaDB ColumnStore Architecture Document for additional information.</p> <ul start="1"><li>How many User Modules (UMs) will your system need? </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>How many Performance Modules (PMs) will your system need? </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>How much disk space will your system need? </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Would have passwordless ssh access between PMs? </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Do you want to run the install as root or noon-root? </li></ul> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="os-information">OS information</h5> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore is certified to run on:</p> <p>RHEL/CentOS v6, v7</p> <p>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</p> <p>Debian v8, v9</p> <p>SUSE 12</p> <p>but it should run on any recent Linux system.</p> <p>Make sure the same OS is installed on all the servers for a multi-node system.</p> <p>Make sure the locale setting on all servers are all the same.</p> <p>To set locale to en_US and UTf-8, run:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
</pre>
<h5 class="anchored_heading" id="system-administration-information">System administration information</h5> <p>Information your system administrator must provide you before you start installing MariaDB ColumnStore:</p> <ul start="1"><li>The hostnames of each interface on each node (optional). </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>The IP address of each interface on each node. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>The root/non-root password for the nodes (all nodes must have the same root/non-root password or root/non-root ssh keys must be set up between servers). MariaDB ColumnStore can be installed as root or a non-root user. </li></ul> <p>Example for 3 PM, 1UM system, these are the steps required to configure PM-1 for passwordless ssh. The equivalent steps must be repeated on every PM in the system. The equivalent steps must be repeated on every UM in the system if the MariaDB ColumnStore Data Replication feature is enabled during the install process.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">[root@pm- 1 ~] $ ssh-keygen
[root@pm- 1 ~] $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pm-1
[root@pm- 1 ~] $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pm-2
[root@pm- 1 ~] $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pm-3
[root@pm- 1 ~] $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub um-1
</pre>
<p>If utilizing ssh-keys and will be utilizing the MariaDB ColumnStore Data Redundancy feature, make sure you setup an ssh-key on the PM1 node to itself. This is required for Data Redundancy feature.</p> <p>If utilizing ssh-keys and will be utilizing the MariaDB ColumnStore Data Replication feature, make sure you setup an ssh-key between all UM nodes. And if you enabled the Local Query Feature, will also need between all UM nodes and all PM nodes.</p> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="network-configuration">Network configuration</h5> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore is quite flexible regarding networking. Some options are as follows:</p> <ul start="1"><li>The interconnect between UMs and PMs can be one or more private VLANs. In this case MariaDB ColumnStore will automatically trunk the individual LANs together to provide greater effective bandwidth between the UMs and PMs. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>The PMs do not require a public LAN access as they only need to communicate with the UMs. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>The UMs most likely require at least one public interface to access the MySQL server front end from the site LAN. This interface can be a separate physical or logical connection from the PM interconnect. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>You can use whatever security your site requires on the public access to the MySQL server front end on the UMs. By default it is listening on port 3306. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore software only requires a TCP/IP stack to be present to function. You can use any physical layer you desire. </li></ul> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-columnstore-port-usage">MariaDB ColumnStore port usage</h4> <p>The MariaDB ColumnStore daemon utilizes port 3306.</p> <p>You must reserve the following ports to run the MariaDB ColumnStore software: 8600 - 8630, 8700, and 8800</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="storage-and-database-files-dbroots">Storage and Database files (DBRoots)</h4> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore supports being able to configure with different Storage options.</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Internal - Meaning you will be utilize the local root level storage on the server. Also with the Internal storage option, you can use softlinks to map the root level data directory to a SAN storage device. With Internal storage setup, there is no High/Availability Performance Module Failover capabilities. This is one of the limitations to using Internal (local) storage. </li>
<li>External - Meaning to can map the root level data directory to EXTx SAN storage devices and have all of the Data directories (DBRoot) configured in the Fstab to have shared mounting to all Performance Modules in the system. With External storage setup, there is High/Availability Performance Module Failover capabilities supported. Meaning if a Performance Module was to go down, another Performance Module would automatically mount to the DBRoots that were previously mounted to the downed Performance Module. Then the system functionality would still be working since the system has access to all the of data on the DBRoots. </li>
<li>Data Redundancy - This feature is support in 1.1 versions and later. MariaDB ColumnStore supports Data Redundancy on both internal root level data directories or if you have them monuted with EXTx SAN devices. For Data Redundancy to be an option, the user is required to install the Third Party GlusterFS software on all Performance Module. This is discussed later the the Package Dependency section. With Data Redundancy storage setup, there is High/Availability Performance Module Failover capabilities supported. Meaning if a Performance Module was to go down, another Performance Module will have a copy of the DBRoots that were on the downed Performance Module. Then the system functionality would still be working since the system has access to all the of data on the DBRoots. </li>
</ul> <p>DBRoots are the MariaDB ColumnStore Datafile containers or directories. For example on a root install, they are /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/data&lt;N&gt; where N is the dbroot number. </p> <p>IMPORTANT: When using Storage (extX, NFS, etc), setup to have the MariaDB front-end data and the DBRoots back-end data files mounted. Don't setup a mount where the actually MariaDB Columnstore package as a whole is mounted, i.e. /usr/local/mariadb or /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore.</p> <p>This would included mounts for:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/mysql/db # optional for the front-end schemas and non-Columnstore data </li>
<li>/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/dataX # DBroots, Columnstore data </li>
</ul> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="local-database-files">Local database files</h5> <p>If you are using local disk to store the database files, the DBRoot directories will be created under the installation directory, for example /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/data&lt;N&gt; where N is the DBRoot number. You should setup to have 1 DBRoot per Performance Module when configuring the system.</p> <p>Use of soft-links for the Data. If you want to setup an install where the Data is stored out in a separate directory in the case you have limit amount local storage, this can be done. It is recommended that the softlinks be setup at the Data Directory Levels, like mariadb/columnstore/data and mariadb/columnstore/dataX. With this setup, you can perform upgrades using any of the package types, rpm, debian, or binary. In the case where you prefer OR have to set a softlink at the top directory, like /usr/local/mariadb, you will need to install using the binary package. If you install using the rpm package and tool, this softlink will be deleted when you perform the upgrade process and the upgrade will fail.</p> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="san-mounted-database-files">SAN mounted database files</h5> <p>If you are using a SAN to store the database files, the following must be taken into account:</p> <ul start="1"><li>Each of these DBRoots must be a separate, mountable partition/directory </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>You might have more than 1 DBRoot assigned to a Performance Module and you can have different number of DBroots per Performance Module, but its recommend to have the same number and same physical size of the storage device on each Performance Module. Here is an example: If you setup 1 Performance Module and you have 2 separate devices that aren't stripped, then you would configure 2 DBRoots to this 1 Performance Module and setup the /etc/fstab with 2 mounts. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore will run on most Linux filesystems, but we test most heavily with EXT2. You should have no problems with EXT3 or EXT4, but the journaling in these filesystems can be expensive for a database application. You should carefully evaluate the write characteristics of your chosen filesystem to make sure they meet your specific business needs. In any event, MariaDB ColumnStore writes relatively few, very large (64MB) files. You should consult with your Linux system administrator to see if configuring a larger bytes-per-inode setting than the default is available in your chosen filesystem. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore supports High Availability failover in the case where a Performance Module was to go down when you are using SAN storage devices. To setup a system to support this, all of the SAN devices would need to be mountable to all of the Performance Modules. So in a system that had 2 Performance Modules and each one had 1 SAN device. If 1 of the Performance Modules was to go offline, the system would automatically detect this and would remount the SAN device from the downed module to the 1 active Performance Module. And the system would be able to continue to perform while the module remain offline. </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>The fstab file must be set up (/etc/fstab). These entries would need to be added to each PM pointing to the all the dbroot(s) being used on all PMs. The 'noauto' option indicates that all dbroots will be associated to every PM but will not be automatically mounted at server startup. The associated dbroots that are assigned to each PM will be specifically mounted to that PM at Columnstore startup. </li></ul> <p>The following example shows an /etc/fstab setup for 2 dbroots total for all PMs, but they can setup any disk type they want:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/dev/sda1 /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/data1 ext2 noatime,nodiratime,noauto 0 0
/dev/sdd1 /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/data2 ext2 noatime,nodiratime,noauto 0 0
</pre>
<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="performance-optimization-considerations">Performance optimization considerations</h4> <p>There are optimizations that should be made when using MariaDB ColumnStore listed below. As always, please consult with your network administrator for additional optimization considerations for your specific installation needs.</p> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="gbe-nic-settings">GbE NIC settings:</h5> <ul start="1"><li>Modify /etc/rc.d/rc.local to include the following: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/sbin/ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 10000
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Modify /etc/sysctl.conf for the following: </li></ul> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># increase TCP max buffer size

net.core.rmem_max = 16777216

net.core.wmem_max = 16777216

# increase Linux autotuning TCP buffer limits

# min, default, and max number of bytes to use

net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216

# don't cache ssthresh from previous connection

net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1

# recommended to increase this for 1000 BT or higher

net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2500

# for 10 GigE, use this

net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 30000

NOTE: Make sure there is only 1 setting of net.core.netdev_max_backlog in the /etc/sysctl.conf file.
</pre>
<ul start="1"><li>Cache memory settings: To optimize Linux to cache directories and inodes the vm.vfs_cache_pressure can be set to a lower value than 100 to attempt to retain caches for inode and directory structures. This will help improve read performance. A value of 10 is suggested. The following commands must all be run as the root user or with sudo. </li></ul> <p>To check the current value:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
</pre>
<p>To set the current value until the next reboot:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=10
</pre>
<p>To set the value permanently across reboots, add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 10
</pre>
<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="system-settings-considerations">System settings considerations</h4> <h5 class="anchored_heading" id="umask-setting">umask setting</h5> <p>The default setting of 022 in /etc/profile is what is recommended. It it required that it the setting doesn't end with a 7, like 077. Example, on a root install, mysqld that runs as 'mysql' user needs to be able to read the MariaDB ColumnStore configuration file, Columnstore.xml. So a last digit of 7 would prevent this and cause the install to fail. </p> <p>The current umask can be determined:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">umask
</pre>
<p>A value of 022 can be set in the current session or in /etc/profile as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">umask 022
</pre>
<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="firewall-considerations">Firewall considerations</h4> <p>The MariaDB ColumnStore utilizes these ports 3306, 8600 - 8630, 8700, and 8800. So on multi-node installs, these ports will need to be accessible between the servers. So if there is any firewall software running on the system that could block these ports, either that firewall would need to be disabled as shown below or the ports listed above will need to be configured to allow both input and output on all servers within the firewall software. You will also want to allow these ports to be passed though on any routers that might be connected between the servers.</p> <p>To disable any local firewalls and SELinux on mutli-node installs</p> <p>You must be a Root user.</p> <p>CentOS 6 and systems using iptables</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#service iptables save  (Will save your existing IPTable Rules)
#service iptables stop  (It will disable firewall Temporarly)
</pre>
<p>To Disable it Permanentely:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#chkconfig iptables off
</pre>
<p>CentOS 7 and systems using systemctl with firewalld installed</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#systemctl status firewalld  
#systemctl stop firewalld  
#systemctl disable firewalld  
</pre>
<p>Ubuntu and systems using ufw</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#service ufw stop  (It will disable firewall Temporary)
</pre>
<p>To Disable it Permanentely:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#chkconfig ufw off
</pre>
<p>SUSE </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">#/sbin/rcSuSEfirewall2 status
#/sbin/rcSuSEfirewall2 stop 
</pre>
<p>To disable SELinux,</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">edit file "/etc/selinux/config" and find line;

Now replace it with,

SELINUX=disabled
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="package-dependencies">Package dependencies</h3> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="boost-libraries">Boost libraries</h4> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore requires that the boost package of 1.53 or newer is installed.</p> <p>For Centos 7, Ubuntu 16, Debian 8, SUSE 12 and other newer OS's, you can just install the boost packages via yum or apt-get. </p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># yum -y install boost
