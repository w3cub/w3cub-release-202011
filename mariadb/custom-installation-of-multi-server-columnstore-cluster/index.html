<h1>Custom Installation of Multi-Server ColumnStore Cluster</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>If you choose not to do the quick install and chose to customize the various options of installations using a wizard, you may use MariaDB ColumnStore postConfigure script.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="custom-install-wizard-postconfigure">Custom Install Wizard: postConfigure</h2> <p>The postConfigure script is a customer wizard to do the system(server and storage) configuration and setup. Before running the postConfigure script, you must have done <a href="../preparing-for-columnstore-installation-12x/index">Preparing for ColumnStore Installation 1.2.x</a> steps and the pre-requisite validation using <a href="../mariadb-columnstore-cluster-test-tool/index">ColumnStore Cluster Tester Tool</a>. Once you have done these steps, then run the postConfigure script from the node designated as PM1. </p> <p>The script can take several parameters. However, all are optional</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Usage: postConfigure [-h][-c][-u][-p][-qs][-qm][-qa][-port][-i][-n][-d][-sn][-pm-ip-addrs][-um-ip-addrs][-pm-count][-um-count]
   -h  Help
   -c  Config File to use to extract configuration data, the default is Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
   -u  Upgrade, Install using the Config File from -c, default to Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
	    If ssh-keys aren't setup, you should provide passwords as command line arguments
   -p  Unix Password, used with no-prompting option
   -qs Quick Install - Single Server
   -qm Quick Install - Multi Server
   -port MariaDB ColumnStore Port Address
   -i Non-root Install directory, Only use for non-root installs
   -n Non-distributed install, meaning postConfigure will not install packages on remote nodes
   -d Distributed install, meaning postConfigure will install packages on remote nodes

   -pm-ip-addrs Performance Module IP Addresses xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   -um-ip-addrs User Module IP Addresses xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</pre>
<p>Running postConfigure is a bit different when launching as root user or a non-root user. As a non-root user, you will be required the setup 2 Environment variables and provide the base directory where MariaDB ColumnStore resides.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="running-postconfigure-as-root-user">Running postConfigure as root user</h4> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure

</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="distributed-vs-non-distributed-options">Distributed vs Non-Distributed options</h3> <p>The postConfigure script supports 2 different types of installs:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Non-Distributed Install </li>
<li>Distributed Install </li>
</ul> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="non-distributed-install">Non-Distributed Install</h4> <p>Before starting postConfigure for Non-Distributed Install, please ensure you have installed the MariaDB ColumnStore packages on all the nodes per <a href="../preparing-for-columnstore-installation-12x/index">Preparation Steps</a>. And on the non-pm1 nodes startup the ColumnStore service before running postConfigure.</p> <p>Non-Distributed Install is the default setting, so no additional command line arguments needs to be provided. </p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="distributed-install">Distributed Install</h4> <p>Distributed Install by postConfigure interacts with all the nodes in the system during the configuration and setup process. It pushes copies of the MariaDB ColumnStore packages from the 'pm1' node where postConfigure is running. During upgrades, it will also make sure the ColumnStore service is stopped and will replace any packages that were previously installed with the new package. Since it pushes the new packages to the other nodes, it is required that the packages be placed in the current home directory of the user doing the install, i.e. /root/ for root user install.</p> <p>Distributed Install does require an additional command line argument "-d" as shown in this example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure -d
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="storage-configuration-options">Storage Configuration Options</h3> <p>When running postConfigure, you will be prompted for the type of storage configuration. Usually the options are 'internal' and 'external'. If GlusterFS is installed, then 'DataRedundancy' will be an option.</p> <p>Check this document to determine which type of storage you will want to select:</p> <p><a href="../library/preparing-for-and-installing-columnstore-version-121/index#storage-and-database-files-dbroots">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/preparing-for-and-installing-columnstore-version-121/#storage-and-database-files-dbroots</a></p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="common-installation-examples">Common Installation Examples</h3> <p>The following is a transcript of a typical run of the MariaDB ColumnStore configuration script. Plain-text formatting indicates output from the script and bold text indicates responses to questions. After each question, there is a short discussion of what the question is asking and what some typical answers might be. You will not see these during the running the actual configuration script.</p> <p>During postConfigure, there are 2 questions that are asked where the answer given determines the path that postConfigure takes in configuring the system. Those 2 questions are as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Select the type of server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt;
</pre>
<p>and</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Select the Type of Module Install being performed:
1. Separate - User and Performance functionalities on separate servers
2. Combined - User and Performance functionalities on the same server
Enter Server Type ID [1-2] (1) &gt;
</pre>
<p>The following examples illustrate some common configurations and helps to provide answers to the above questions:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Single Node - User and Performance running on 1 server - single / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #1 - User and Performance running on some server - multi / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #2 - User and Performance running on separate servers - multi / separate </li>
</ul> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="distributed-install-example">Distributed Install example</h4> <p>This is an example of a Distributed Install of a 1UM/2PM system with internal storage. MariaDB ColumnStore 'rpm's packages was installed for this example. No password is provide on the command line, so the root user password is provided when prompted.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql"># /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure -d

<p>IMPORTANT: If postConfigure fails at any point, you can use the following guides to help trouble shoot any issues. And once an issue has been fixed, it is required that you re-run postConfigure until you get a successful completion.</p> <p><a href="../library/system-troubleshooting-mariadb-columnstore/index#multi-node-install-problems-and-how-to-diagnose">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/system-troubleshooting-mariadb-columnstore/#multi-node-install-problems-and-how-to-diagnose</a></p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-columnstore-memory-configuration">MariaDB Columnstore Memory Configuration</h2> <p>During the installation process, postConfigure will set the 2 main Memory configuration settings based on the size of memory detected on the local node.</p> <p>The 2 settings are in the MariaDB Columnstore Configuration file, /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/etc/Columnstore.xml. These 2 settings are:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">'NumBlocksPct'   - Performance Module Data cache memory setting

TotalUmMemory  - User Module memory setting, used as temporary memory for joins
</pre>
<p>On a system that has the Performance Module and User Module functionality combined on the same server, this is the default settings:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NumBlocksPct    - 50% of total memory

TotalUmMemory - 25% of total memory, default maximum the percentage equal to 16G
</pre>
<p>On a system that has the Performance Module and User Module functionality on different servers, this is the default settings:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NumBlocksPct    - This setting is NOT configured, and the default that the applications will then use is 70%

TotalUmMemory - 50% of total memory 
</pre>
<p>The user can choose to change these settings after the install is completed if for instance, they want to set up more memory for Joins to utilize. On a single server or combined UM/PM server, it is recommended to not have the combination of these 2 settings over 75% of total memory</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
