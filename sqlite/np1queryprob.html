<h1 class="fancy_title"> Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite </h1>  <h2 id="executive_summary">
<span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h2> <ul> <li><p> 200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. </p></li>
<li><p> But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem. </p></li>
<li><p> SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like client/server databases. But SQLite can do many smaller queries efficiently too. Application developers can use whichever technique works best for the task at hand. </p></li>
</ul> <h2 id="the_perceived_problem">
<span>2. </span>The Perceived Problem</h2> <p> The <a href="whentouse#website">Appropriate Uses For SQLite</a> page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples: </p>
<ul> <li><p> <i>"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"</i> </p></li>
<li><p> <i>"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."</i> </p></li>
<li><p> <i>"[This is] bad design"</i> </p></li>
</ul> <p> Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern. </p>
<h2 id="n_1_queries_are_not_a_problem_with_sqlite">
<span>3. </span>N+1 Queries Are Not A Problem With SQLite</h2> <p> SQLite is <u>not</u> client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem. </p>
<h2 id="the_need_for_over_200_sql_statements_per_webpage">
<span>4. </span>The Need For Over 200 SQL Statements Per Webpage</h2> <p> The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by the <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control system</a>. A typical dynamic page would be a timeline such as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline">https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline</a>. A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below. </p>
<p> The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database. Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements to be displayed on the timeline. This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O. </p>
<p> Following the single big "timeline" query, there are additional queries for each timeline element. Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying to grab all the information in as few queries as possible. But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead. At the bottom of each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate the page. For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than 25 milliseconds. Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds were spent inside the database engine. </p>
<p> Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application. But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits. For one, the section of the code that creates the timeline query can be completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline entry for display. This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code simple and easy to maintain. Secondly, the information needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information, vary according to what type of objects to be shown. Check-ins need one set of queries. Tickets need another set of queries. Wiki pages need a different query. And so forth. By implementing these queries on-demand and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall code base. </p>
<p> So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can do many smaller and simpler queries. Both are efficient. An application can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the situation at hand. </p>
<p> The following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular timeline (captured on 2016-09-16): </p>
