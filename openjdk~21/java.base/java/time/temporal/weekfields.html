This class represents the definition of the week, for the purpose of providing <a href="temporalfield" title="interface in java.time.temporal"><code>TemporalField</code></a> instances. </p>
<p> WeekFields provides five fields, <a href="#dayOfWeek()"><code>dayOfWeek()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfMonth()"><code>weekOfMonth()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfYear()"><code>weekOfYear()</code></a>, <a href="#weekOfWeekBasedYear()"><code>weekOfWeekBasedYear()</code></a>, and <a href="#weekBasedYear()"><code>weekBasedYear()</code></a> that provide access to the values from any <a href="temporal" title="interface in java.time.temporal">temporal object</a>. </p>
<p> The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based on the <a href="chronofield#YEAR">proleptic-year</a>, <a href="chronofield#MONTH_OF_YEAR">month-of-year</a>, <a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_MONTH">day-of-month</a>, and <a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_WEEK">ISO day-of-week</a> which are based on the <a href="chronofield#EPOCH_DAY">epoch-day</a> and the chronology. The values may not be aligned with the <a href="chronofield#YEAR_OF_ERA">year-of-Era</a> depending on the Chronology. </p>
<p>A week is defined by: </p>
<ul> <li>The first day-of-week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week. </li>
<li>The minimal number of days in the first week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days. </li>
</ul> Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks. <h2 id="week-of-month-heading">Week of Month</h2> One field is used: week-of-month. The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary. The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week. The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days. <table class="striped" style="text-align: left"> <caption>Examples of WeekFields</caption> <thead> <tr>

In a week-based-year, each week belongs to only a single year. Week 1 of a year is the first week that starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days.
