Vale, the documentation linter, reports the errors it finds in the <strong>Problems</strong> pane of Visual Studio Code. The errors are also reflected in the documentation source code, as close to the problem as possible.</p> <p>For more information about documentation linting and resolving lint problems, see <a href="docs-lint-errors">Resolve documentation linter messages</a>.</p> <h2 id="save-your-changes">Save your changes</h2> <p>As you make changes to the documentation source files on your local computer, your changes can be in one of these states.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Made, but not saved</strong></p> <p> This is the state of your changes as you edit a file in your integrated development environment (IDE).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Saved, but not committed</strong></p> <p> After you save changes to a file from the IDE, they are saved to your local computer.

Testing documentation consists of:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Documentation linting</strong></p> <p> Each time you open and save a documentation topic, the documentation linter checks for common errors. For more information about documentation linting, see <a href="docs-lint-errors">Resolving documentation linter messages</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Manual review</strong></p> <p> When your documentation update is complete, have another person review your changes. If you have updated technical content, have a subject matter expert on the topic review your update, as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Automated testing</strong></p> <p> The Angular documentation is tested automatically after you open a pull request. It must pass this testing before the pull request can be merged.
