<h1 class="settitle">GnuCOBOL</h1>      <h1 class="top">GnuCOBOL Programmer’s Guide</h1>     <h2 class="unnumbered" id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>  <p>This document describes the syntax, semantics and use of the COBOL programming language as implemented by GnuCOBOL, formerly known as OpenCOBOL. </p> <p>The original principal developers of GnuCOBOL were Keisuke Nishida and Roger While. Since then, many members of the community have been involved in its development. </p> <p>This document is intended to serve as a fully functional reference and user’s guide, suitable for both those readers learning COBOL for the first time as a training tool, as well as those already familiar with another dialect of COBOL. </p> <p>A separate manual — containing only the details of the GnuCOBOL implementation and designed for experienced COBOL programmers — has been taken from this guide. That document (<i>GnuCOBOL Quick Reference</i>) contains <i>no</i> training subject matter. </p> <p>Other documents that should be read is the <samp>gnucobol.pdf</samp> found in the <samp>doc</samp> directory of the compiler sources and the file <samp>NEWS</samp> supplied with the source code of the GnuCOBOL compiler, in the top-level directory. There you will find the latest COBOL language features that have been added, some of which may not be in this document due to time constraints. If you find any, please report it as a bug for the Programmer’s Guide so that it can be fixed. </p> <p>Yet another document which delves deeper in to the compiler that is a <i>must</i> read, is the FAQ available via the GnuCOBOL <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/#faq">Manuals and Guides</a>, although it could do with a wee clean up to ease reading and finding required information. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Additional-Reference-Sources">1.1. Additional Reference Sources</h2> <p>For those wishing to learn COBOL for the first time, Gary can strongly recommend the following resources. </p> <p>If you like to hold a book in your hands, I strongly recommend <i>Murach’s Structured COBOL</i>, by Mike Murach, Anne Prince and Raul Menendez (2000) - ISBN 9781890774059. Mike Murach and his various writing partners have been writing outstanding COBOL textbooks for decades. It’s an excellent book for those familiar with the concepts of programming in other languages, but unfamiliar with COBOL. </p> <p>Would you prefer a web-based tutorial? Try the University of Limerick (Ireland) - <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/">COBOL web site</a>. </p> <p>In addition there is the <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/faq/index.html">GnuCOBOL FAQ</a> — which has now exceeded 1,400 pages — available as HTML or a downloadable <samp>.pdf</samp> file. </p> <p>Along with every release of the compiler sources is the file <samp>NEWS</samp>. It contains up to the minute updates regarding the compiler and additional COBOL language elements which may well <i>not</i> be yet included in this manual. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Introducing-COBOL">1.2. Introducing COBOL</h2> <p>If you already know a programming language other than COBOL, chances are that language is Java, C or C++. You will find COBOL much different from those; sometimes the differences are a good thing and sometimes they aren’t. The thing to remember about COBOL is this: <i>it was designed to solve business problems</i>. </p> <p>COBOL, first introduced to the programming public in 1959, was the very first programming language to become standardized (in 1960). This meant that a standard-compliant COBOL program written on computer “A” made by company “B” would be able to be compiled and executed on computer “X” made by company “Y” with very few, if any, changes. This may not seem like such a big deal today, but it was a radical departure from all programming languages that came before it and even many that came after it. </p> <p>The name <span>COBOL</span> actually says it all — COBOL is an acronym that stands for “(<b>CO</b>)mmon (<b>B</b>)usiness (<b>O</b>)riented (<b>L</b>)anguage”. Note the fact that the word “common” comes before all others. The word “business” is a close second. Therein lies the key to COBOL’s success. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Why-YOU-Should-Learn-COBOL">1.2.1. Why YOU Should Learn COBOL</h3> <p>Despite statements from industry “insiders”, the COBOL programming language is not dead, even though newer and so-called “modern” languages like Java, C#, .NET, Ruby on Rails and so on appear to have become the languages of choice in the Information Technology world. These languages have become popular because they address the following desired requirements for “modern” programming: </p> <p>Just because COBOL doesn’t traditionally support objects, classes, and the like doesn’t mean that its “procedural” approach to computing isn’t valuable — after all, it runs 70% of the <i>worlds</i> business transactions, and does so: </p>
<ul> <li> Using programs that, for the most part, are much more self-documenting than would be the case with any other programming language. </li>
<li> Effortlessly providing arithmetic accuracy to 31 digits, with performance approaching that of well-written assembly-language programs. Don’t think this isn’t critically important to banks, investment houses and any business interested in tracking revenues, expenses and profits (duh - like ALL of them). </li>
<li> Integrating well with non-COBOL infrastructures such as XML, SOA, MQ, almost any DBMS, Transaction Processing platforms, Queue-Management facilities and other programming languages. </li>
<li> By running on almost as many different computing platforms as Java can. You can’t run COBOL programs in your smart phone, but desktops, workstations, midframes/servers, mainframes and supercomputers are all fair game. </li>
</ul> <p>Today’s IT managers and business leaders are faced with a challenging dilemma — how do you maintain the enormous COBOL code base that is still running their businesses when academia has all but abandoned the language they need their people to use to keep the wheels rolling? The problem is compounded by the fact that those programmers that are skilled in COBOL are retiring and taking their knowledge with them. In some markets, this appears to be having an inflationary effect on the cost of resources (COBOL programmers) whose supply is becoming smaller and smaller. The pressure to update applications to make use of more up-to-date graphical user interfaces is also perceived as a reason to abandon COBOL in favour of GUI-friendly languages such as Java. </p> <p>Businesses are addressing the COBOL challenge in different ways: </p>
<ol> <li> By undertaking so-called “modernization projects”, where existing applications are either rewritten in “modern” languages or replaced outright with purchased packages. Most of these businesses are using such activities as an excuse to abandon “expensive” mainframes in favour of (presumably) less-expensive “open systems” (mid frame/server) solutions. </li>
<li> Many times these businesses are finding the cost of the system/networking engineering, operational management and monitoring and risk management (i.e. disaster recovery) infrastructures necessary to support truly mission-critical applications to be so high that the “less-expensive” solution really isn’t; in these cases the mainframe may remain the best option, thus leaving COBOL in play and businesses seeking another solution for at least part of their application base. </li>
<li> Training their own COBOL programmers. Since colleges, universities and technical schools have lost interest in doing so, many businesses have undertaken the task of “growing their own” new crop of COBOL programmers. Fear of being pigeon-holed into a niche technology is a factor inhibiting many of today’s programmers from willingly volunteering for such training. </li>
<li> By moving the user-interface onto the desktop; such efforts involve running modern-language front-end clients on user desktops (or laptops or smart phones, etc.) with COBOL programs providing server functionality on mainframe or midframe platforms, providing all the database and file “heavy lifting” on the back-end. Solutions like this provide users with the user-interfaces they want/need while still leveraging COBOL’s strengths on (possibly) downsized legacy mainframe or midframe systems. </li>
</ol> <p>It’s probably a true that an IT professional can no longer afford to allow COBOL to be the <i>only</i> wrench in their toolbox, but with a massive code base still in production now and for the foreseeable future, adding COBOL to a multi-lingual curriculum vitae (CV) and/or resume (yes — they ARE different) is not a bad thing at all. Knowing COBOL as well as the language du-jour will make you the smartest person in the room when the discussion of migrating the current “legacy” environment to a “modern” implementation comes around. </p> <p>You’ll find COBOL an easy language to learn and a FAR EASIER language to master than many of the “modern” languages. </p> <p>The whole reason you’re reading this is that you’ve discovered GnuCOBOL — another implementation of COBOL in addition to those mentioned earlier. The distinguishing characteristic of GnuCOBOL versus those others is that GnuCOBOL is FREE open-source and therefore FREE to obtain and use. It is community-enhanced and community-supported. Later in this document (see <a href="#So-What-is-GnuCOBOL_003f">So What is GnuCOBOL?</a>), you’ll begin to learn more about this COBOL implementation’s capabilities. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Programmer-Productivity">1.2.2. Programmer Productivity</h3> <p>Throughout the history of computer programming, the search for new ways to improve of the productivity of programmers has been a major consideration. Other than hobbyists, programming is an activity performed for money, and businesses abhor spending anything more than is absolutely necessary; even government agencies try to spend as little money on projects as is absolutely necessary. </p> <p>The amount of programming necessary to accomplish a given task — including rework needed by any errors found during testing (testing is sometimes jokingly defined as: <i>that time during which an application is actually in production, allowing users to discover the problems</i>) is the measure of programmer productivity. Anything that reduces that effort will therefore reduce the time spent in such activities therefore reducing the expense of same. When the expense of programming is reduced, programmer productivity is increased. </p> <p>Sometimes the quest for improved programmer productivity (and therefore reduced programming <i>expense</i>) has taken the form of introducing new features in programming languages, or even new languages altogether. Sometimes it has resulted in new ways of using the existing languages. </p> <p>While many technological and procedural developments have made <i>evolutionary</i> improvements to programmer productivity, each of the following three events has been responsible for <i>revolutionary</i> improvements: </p>
<ul> <li> The development of so-called “higher-level” programming languages that enable a programmer to specify in a single statement of the language an action that would have required many more separate statements in a prior programming language. The standardization of such languages, making them usable on a wide variety of computers and operating systems, was a key aspect of this development. COBOL was a pioneering development in this area, being a direct descendant of the very first higher-level language (FLOW-MATIC, developed by US Naval Lieutenant Grace Hopper) and the first to become standardized. </li>
<li> The establishment of programming techniques that make programs easier to read and therefore easier to understand. Not only do such techniques reduce the amount of rework necessary simply to make a program work as designed, but they also reduce the amount of time a programmer needs to study an existing program in order how to best adapt it to changing business requirements. The foremost development in this area was structured programming. Introduced in the late 1970’s, this approach to programming spawned new programming languages (<span>PASCAL</span>, <span>ALGOL</span>, <span>PL/1</span> and so forth) designed around it. With the ANSI 85 standard, COBOL embraced the principles espoused by structured programming mavens as well as any of the languages designed strictly around it. </li>
<li> The establishment of programming techniques AND the introduction of programming language capabilities to facilitate the re-usability of program code. Anything that supports code re-usability can have a profound impact to the amount of time it takes to develop new applications or to make significant changes to existing ones. In recent years, object-oriented programming (OOP) has been the industry “poster child” for code re-usability. By enabling program logic and the data structures that logic manipulates to be encapsulated into easily stored and retrieved (and therefore “reusable”) modules called classes, the object-oriented languages such as Java, C++ and C# have become the favourites of academia. Since students are being trained in these languages and only these, by and large, it’s no surprise that — today — object-oriented programming languages are the darlings of the industry. <p>The reality is, however, that good programmers have been practising code re-usability for more than a half-century. Up until recently, COBOL programmers have had some of the best code re-usability tools available — they’ve been doing it with copybooks and subprograms rather than classes, methods and attributes but the net results have been similar. With the COBOL2002 and the COBOL 2014 standards, the COBOL programming language has become just as “object-oriented” as the “modern” languages, while preserving the ability to support, modify, compile and execute “legacy” COBOL programs as well. </p>
</li>
</ul> <p>While GnuCOBOL supports few of the OOP programming constructs defined by the COBOL2002 and COBOL2014 standards, it supports every aspect of the ANSI 85 standard and therefore fully meets the needs of points #1 and #2, above. With its supported feature set (see <a href="#So-What-is-GnuCOBOL_003f">So What is GnuCOBOL?</a>), it provides significant programmer productivity capabilities. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="So-What-is-GnuCOBOL_003f">1.3. So What is GnuCOBOL?</h2> <p>GnuCOBOL is a free and open sourced COBOL compiler and runtime environment, written using the C programming language. GnuCOBOL is typically distributed in source-code form, and must then be built for your computer’s operating system using the system’s C compiler and loader. While originally developed for the UNIX and Linux operating systems, GnuCOBOL has also been successfully built for computers running OSX and Windows utilizing the UNIX-emulation features of such tools as Cygwin and MinGW. Also see the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnucobol">GNU website</a> for more information at. </p> <p>The MinGW approach is a personal favourite with the author of this manual because it creates a GnuCOBOL compiler and runtime library that require only a single MinGW DLL to be available for the GnuCOBOL compiler, runtime library and user programs. That DLL is freely distributable under the terms of the GNU General Public License. A MinGW build of GnuCOBOL fits easily on and runs from a 128MB flash drive with no need to install any software onto the Windows computer that will be using it. Some functionality of the language, dealing with the sharing of files between concurrently executing GnuCOBOL programs and record locking on certain types of files, is sacrificed however as the underlying operating system routines needed to implement them aren’t available to Windows and aren’t provided by MinGW. The current version for MinGW is available at the download link along with various other platforms at the GnuCOBOL <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/files/gnu-cobol">download website</a>. </p> <p>GnuCOBOL has also been built as a truly native Windows application utilizing Microsoft’s freely-downloadable Visual Studio Express package to provide the C compiler and linker/loader. This approach does not lend itself well to a “portable” distribution. </p> <p>The GnuCOBOL compiler generates C code from your COBOL programs; that C code is then automatically compiled and linked using your system’s C compiler (typically, but not limited to, <code>gcc</code>). </p> <p>GnuCOBOL fully supports much of the ANSI 85 standard for COBOL (the only major exclusion is the Communications Module) and also supports some of the components of the COBOL2002 and COBOL2014 standards, such as the <code>SCREEN SECTION</code> (see <a href="#SCREEN-SECTION">SCREEN SECTION</a>), table-based <code>SORT</code> (see <a href="#Table-SORT">Table SORT</a>) and user-defined functions. There are others with more being added almost weekly. </p>    <h2 class="unnumbered" id="COBOL-Fundamentals">2. COBOL Fundamentals</h2>  <p>This chapter describes the syntax, semantics and usage of the COBOL programming language as implemented by the current version of GnuCOBOL. For the rest of this document the Language is spelt as COBOL to ease reading however the compiler name retains the mixed case of GnuCOBOL. </p> <p>This document is intended to serve as a full-function reference and user’s guide suitable for both those readers learning COBOL for the first time as usage as a training tool, as well as those already familiar with some dialects of the COBOL language. </p> <p>A separate manual exists that just contains the details of the Cobol grammar as implemented in GnuCOBOL, which is designed strictly for experienced COBOL programmers and this is taken from this guide. This does NOT contain any training subject matter. </p> <p>These extra manuals are: GnuCOBOL Quick Reference containing just the COBOL semantics / grammar in a short document while the other, GnuCOBOL Sample Programs, shows detailed example Cobol programs with indication of syntax used in each program. </p> <p>For each implementation of the GnuCOBOL compiler the supplied files NEWS should also be read for any last minute updates along with files README and INSTALL for building the compiler. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="The-COBOL-Language-_002d-The-Basics">2.1. The COBOL Language - The Basics</h2>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Language-Reserved-Words">2.1.1. Language Reserved Words</h3> <p>Cobol programs consist of a sequence of words and symbols. Words, which consist of sequences of letters (upper- and/or lower-case), digits, dashes (‘<samp>-</samp>’) and/or underscores (‘<samp>_</samp>’) may have a pre-defined, specific, meaning to the compiler or may be invented by the programmer for his/her purposes. </p> <p>The GnuCOBOL language specification defines over 1130  <em>Reserved Words</em> — words to which the compiler assigns a special meaning. This list and number applies to the default list which covers many implementations and that it is possible to limit the list to either a specific implementation via -std=xyz[-strict] or to manually unreserve words if they are used in existing sources as user-defined words. </p> <p>Programmers may use a reserved word as <i>part</i> of a word they are creating themselves, but may not create their own word as an exact duplicate (without regard to case) of a COBOL reserved word. Note that a reserved word includes all classes, such as intrinsic functions, mnemonics names, system routines and reserved words. The list of reserved words can be changed by adding or removing specific words for a given compile or as a default by use of the steering command -std and -conf. See the specific config files that are by default, held in <samp>/usr/local/share/gnucobol/config</samp>. Also using the option ‘<samp>FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC</samp>’, will add another 100+ reserved words. These can be modified to match the requirements of a business or project team but be warned that these are updated when a new version of the compiler is built so might be more prudent to create your own configuation based on an existing one but with a different name. </p> <p>In addition, you can add and/or remove reserved words by adding one of these options to cobc to add <samp>-freserved-words=<var>value</var></samp> or <samp>-freserved=<var>word</var></samp> or, to remove, <samp>-fnot-reserved=<var>word</var></samp>. As well as <samp>-freserved=<var>word</var>:<var>alias</var></samp> to create an alias for a word as well as <samp>-fnot-register=<var>word</var></samp> or <samp>-fregister=<var>word</var></samp> to remove or add, a special register word. </p> <p>See <a href="#Appendix-B-_002d-Reserved-Word-List">Appendix B - Reserved Word List</a>, for a complete list of GnuCOBOL reserved words . </p> <p>For any given version of GnuCOBOL you can also list the full current set of reserved words by running cobc with <samp>--list-reserved</samp>, <samp>--list-intrinsic</samp>, <samp>--list-system</samp> as well as <samp>--list-mnemonics</samp>. Again subject to variation depending on usage of the <samp>--std</samp> line command. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="User_002dDefined-Words">2.1.2. User-Defined Words</h3> <p>When you write GnuCOBOL programs, you’ll need to create a variety of words to represent various aspects of the program, the program’s data and the external environment in which the program will run. This will include internal names by which data files will be referenced, data item names and names of executable logic procedures. </p> <p>User-defined words may be composed from the characters ‘<samp>A</samp>’ through ‘<samp>Z</samp>’ (upper- and/or lower-case), ‘<samp>0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>9</samp>’, dash (‘<samp>-</samp>’)  and underscore (‘<samp>_</samp>’).  User-defined words may neither start nor end with hyphen or underscore characters. </p> <p>Other programming languages provide the programmer with a similar capability of creating their own words (names) for parts of a program; COBOL is somewhat unusual when compared to other languages in that user-defined words may <i>start</i> with a digit. </p> <p>With the exception of logic procedure names, which may consist entirely of nothing but digits, user-defined words must contain at least one letter. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Case-Insensitivity">2.1.3. Case Insensitivity</h3> <p>All COBOL implementations allow the use of both upper and lower case letters in program coding. GnuCOBOL is completely insensitive to the case used when writing reserved words or user-defined names. Thus, <code>AAAAA</code>, <code>aaaaa</code>, <code>Aaaaa</code> and <code>AaAaA</code> are all the same word as far as GnuCOBOL is concerned. </p> <p>The only time the case used does matter is within quoted character strings, where character values will be exactly as coded. </p> <p>By convention throughout this document, COBOL reserved words will be shown entirely in <code>UPPER-CASE</code> while those words that were created by a programmer will be represented by tokens in mixed or lower case. </p> <p>This isn’t a bad practice to use in actual programs, as it leads to programs where it is much easier to distinguish reserved words from user-defined ones! </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Readability-of-Programs">2.1.4. Readability of Programs</h3> <p>Critics of COBOL frequently focus on the wordiness of the language, often citing the case of a so-called “Hello World” program as the “proof” that COBOL is so much more tedious to program in than more “modern” languages. This tedium is cited as such a significant impact to programmer productivity that, in their opinions, COBOL can’t go away quickly enough. </p> <p>Here are two different “Hello World” applications, one written in Java and the second in GnuCOBOL. First, the Java version: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    Class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
</pre> <p>And here is the same program, written in GnuCOBOL: </p> <pre class="verbatim">    IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    PROGRAM-ID. HelloWorld.
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
        DISPLAY "Hello World!".
</pre> <p>Both of the above programs could have been written on a single line, if desired, and both languages allow a programmer to use (or not use) indentation as they see fit to improve program readability. Sounds like a tie so far. </p> <p>Let’s look at how much more “wordy” COBOL is than Java. Count the characters in the two programs. The Java program has 95 (not counting carriage returns and any indentation). The COBOL program has 89 (again, not counting carriage returns and indentation)! Technically, it could have been only 65 because the <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.</code> header is actually optional. Clearly, “Hello World” doesn’t look any more concise in Java than it does in COBOL. </p> <p>Let’s look at a different problem. Surely a program that asks a user to input a positive integer, generates the sum of all positive integers from 1 to that number and then prints the result will be MUCH shorter and MUCH easier to understand when coded in Java than in COBOL, right? </p> <p>You can be the judge. First, the Java version: </p> <pre class="verbatim">    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class sumofintegers {
        public static void main(String[] arg) {
            System.out.println("Enter a positive integer");
            Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
            int n=scan.nextInt();
            int sum=0;
            for (int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++) {
                sum+=i;
            }
            System.out.println("The sum is "+sum);
        }
    }
</pre> <p>And now for the COBOL version: </p> <pre class="verbatim">    IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    PROGRAM-ID. SumOfIntegers.
    DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
    01 n   BINARY-LONG.
    01 i   BINARY-LONG.
    01 sum BINARY-LONG VALUE 0.
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Enter a positive integer"
    ACCEPT n
    PERFORM VARYING i FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL i &gt; n
        ADD i TO sum

</pre> <p>My familiarity with COBOL may be prejudicing my opinion, but it doesn’t appear to me that the Java code is any simpler than the COBOL code. In case you’re interested in character counts, the Java code comes in at 278 (not counting indentation characters). The COBOL code is 298 (274 without the <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.</code> header). </p> <p>Despite what you’ve seen here, the more complex the programming logic being implemented, the more concise the Java code will appear to be, even compared to 2002-standard COBOL. That conciseness comes with a price though — program code readability. Java (or C or C++ or C#) programs are generally intelligible only to trained programmers. COBOL programs can, however, be quite understandable by non-programmers. This is actually a side-effect of the “wordiness” of the language, where COBOL statements use natural English words to describe their actions. This inherent readability has come in handy many times throughout my career when I’ve had to learn obscure business (or legal) processes by reading the COBOL program code that supports them. </p> <p>The “modern” languages, like Java, also have their own “boilerplate” infrastructure overhead that must be coded in order to write the logic that is necessary in the program. Take for example the <code>public static void main(String[] arg)</code> and <code>import java.util.Scanner;</code> statements. The critics tend to forget about this when they criticize COBOL for its structural “overhead”. </p> <p>When it first was developed, COBOL’s easily-readable syntax made it profoundly different from anything that had been seen before. For the first time, it was possible to specify logic in a manner that was — at least to some extent — comprehensible even to non-programmers. Take for example, the following code written in FORTRAN — a language developed only a year before COBOL: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    EXT = PRICE * IQTY
    INVTOT = INVTOT + EXT
</pre> <p>With its original limitation on the length of variable names (one- to six-character names comprised of a letter followed by up to five letters and/or digits), its implicit rule that variables were automatically created as real (floating-point) unless their name started with a letter in the range I-N, and its use of algebraic notation to express actions being taken, FORTRAN wasn’t a particularly readable language, even for programmers. Compare this with the equivalent COBOL code: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    MULTIPLY price BY quantity GIVING extended-amount
    ADD extended-amount TO invoice-total
</pre> <p>Clearly, even a non-programmer could at least conceptually understand what was going on! Over time, languages like FORTRAN evolved more robust variable names, and COBOL introduced a more formula-based syntactical capability for arithmetic operations, but FORTRAN was never as readable as COBOL. </p> <p>Because of its inherent readability, I would MUCH rather be handed an assignment to make significant changes to a COBOL program about which I know nothing than to be asked to do the same with a C, C++, C# or Java program. </p> <p>Those that argue that it is too boring / wasteful / time-consuming / insulting (pick one) to have to code a COBOL program “from scratch” are clearly ignorant of the following facts: </p>
<ul> <li> Many systems have program-development tools available to ease the task of coding programs; those tools that concentrate on COBOL are capable of providing templates for much of the “overhead” verbiage of any program… </li>
<li> Good programmers have — for decades — maintained their own skeleton “template” programs for a variety of program types; simply load a template into a text editor and you’ve got a good start to the program… </li>
<li> Legend has it that there’s actually only been ONE program ever written in COBOL, and all programs ever “written” thereafter were simply derivatives of that one. Although this is clearly intended as a (probably) bad joke, it is nevertheless close to the very simple truth that many programmers“reuse” existing COBOL programs when creating new ones. There’s certainly nothing preventing this from happening with programs written in other languages, but it does seem to happen more in COBOL shops. It’s ironic that “code re-usability” is one of the arguments used to justify the existence of the “modern” languages. </li>
</ul>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Divisions-Organize-Programs">2.1.5. Divisions Organize Programs</h3> <p>COBOL programs are structured into four major areas of coding, each with its own purpose. These four areas are known as divisions. </p> <p>Each division may consist of a variety of sections and each section consists of one or more paragraphs. A paragraph consists of sentences, each of which consists of one or more statements. </p> <p>This hierarchical structure of program components standardizes the composition of all COBOL programs. Much of this manual describes the various divisions, sections, paragraphs and statements that may comprise any COBOL program. <code>COPY</code> statement (see <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>) </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Copybooks">2.1.6. Copybooks</h3> <p>A  <em>Copybook</em> is a segment of program code that may be utilized by multiple programs simply by having those programs use the <code>COPY</code> statement to import that code. This code may define files, data structures or procedural code. </p> <p>Today’s current programming languages have a statement (usually, this statement is named “import”, “include” or “#include”) that performs this same function. What makes the COBOL copybook feature different than the “include” facility in newer languages, however, is the fact that the <code>COPY</code> statement can edit the imported source code as it is being copied. This capability makes copybook libraries extremely valuable to making code reusable. Also see section 3. Compiler Directing Facility commands COPY and REPLACE. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Structured-Data">2.1.7. Structured Data</h3> <p>A contiguous area of storage within the memory space of a program that may be referenced, by name, in a COBOL program is referred to as a  <em>Data Item</em>. Other programming languages use the term variable, property or attribute to describe the same thing. </p> <p>COBOL introduced the concept of structured data. The principle of structured data in COBOL is based on the idea of being able to group related and contiguously-allocated data items together into a single aggregate data item, called a  <em>Group Item</em>. For example, a 35-character ’Employee-Name’ group item might consist of a 20-character ’Last-Name’ followed by a 14-character ’First-Name’ and a 1-character ’Middle-Initial’. </p> <p>A data item that isn’t itself formed from other data items is referred to in COBOL as an  <em>Elementary Item</em>. In the previous example, ’Last-Name’, ’First-Name’ and ’Middle-Initial’ are all elementary items. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Files">2.1.8. Files</h3> <p>One of COBOL’s strengths is the wide variety of data files it is capable of accessing. GnuCOBOL programs, like those created with other COBOL implementations, need to have the structure of any files they will be reading and/or writing described to them. The highest-level characteristic of a file’s structure is defined by specifying the organization of the file, as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>These are files with the simplest of all internal structures. Their contents are structured simply as a series of identically- or differently-sized data records, each terminated by a special end-of-record delimiter character. An ASCII line-feed character (hexadecimal 0A) is the end-of-record delimiter character used by any UNIX or pseudo-UNIX (MinGW, Cygwin, OSX) GnuCOBOL build. A truly native Windows build would use a carriage-return, line-feed (hexadecimal 0D0A) sequence. </p> <p>Records must be read from or written to these files in a purely sequential manner. The only way to read (or write) record number 100 would be to have read (or written) records number 1 through 99 first. </p> <p>When the file is written to by a GnuCOBOL program, the delimiter sequence will be automatically appended to each data record as it is written to the file. A <code>WRITE</code> (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>) to this type of file will be done as if a <code>BEFORE ADVANCING 1 LINE</code> clause were specified on the <code>WRITE</code>, if no <code>ADVANCING</code> clause is coded. </p> <p>When the file is read, the GnuCOBOL runtime system will strip the trailing delimiter sequence from each record. The data will be padded (on the right) with spaces if the data just read is shorter than the area described for data records in the program. If the data is too long, it will be truncated and the excess will be lost. </p> <p>These files should not be defined to contain any exact binary data fields because the contents of those fields could inadvertently have the end-of-record sequence as part of their values — this would confuse the runtime system when reading the file, and it would interpret that value as an actual end-of-record sequence. </p>  
</dd> <dt><code>LINE ADVANCING</code></dt> <dd>
<p>These are files with an internal structure similar to that of a line sequential file. These files are defined (without an explicit <code>ORGANIZATION</code> specification) using the <code>LINE ADVANCING</code> clause on their <code>SELECT</code> statement (see <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a>). </p> <p>When this kind of file is written to by a GnuCOBOL program, an end-of-record delimiter sequence will be automatically added to each data record as it is written to the file. A <code>WRITE</code> to this type of file will be done as if an <code>AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE</code> clause were specified on the <code>WRITE</code>, if no <code>ADVANCING</code> clause is coded. </p> <p>Like line sequential files, these files should not be defined to contain any exact binary data fields because the contents of those fields could inadvertently have the end-of-record sequence as part of their values — this would confuse the runtime system when reading the file, and it would interpret that value as an actual end-of-record sequence. </p> </dd> <dt><code>ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>These files also have a simple internal structure. Their contents are structured simply as an arbitrarily-long sequence of data characters. This sequence of characters will be treated as a series of fixed-length records simply by logically splitting the sequence of characters up into fixed-length segments, each as long as the maximum record size defined in the program. There are no special end-of-record delimiter characters in the file and when the file is written to by a GnuCOBOL program, no delimiter sequence is appended to the data. </p> <p>Records in this type of file are all the same physical length, except possibly for the very last record in the file, which may be shorter than the others. If variable-length logical records are defined to the program, the space occupied by each physical record in the file will occupy the space described by the longest record description in the program. </p> <p>So, if a file contains 1275 characters of data, and a program defines the structure of that file as containing 100-character records, then the file contents will consist of twelve (12) 100-character records with a final record containing only 75 characters. </p> <p>It would appear that it should be possible to locate and process any record in the file directly simply by calculating its starting character position based upon the program-defined record size. Even so, however, records must be still be read or written to these files in a purely sequential manner. The only way to read (or write) record number 100 would be to have read (or written) records number 1 through 99 first. </p> <p>When the file is read, the data is transferred into the program exactly as it exists in the file. In the event that a short record is read as the very last record, that record will be padded (to the right) with spaces. </p> <p>Care must be taken that programs reading such a file describe records whose length is exactly the same as that used by the program that created the file. For example, the following shows the contents of a <code>SEQUENTIAL</code> file created by a program that wrote five 6-character records to it. The ‘<samp>A</samp>’, ‘<samp>B</samp>’, … values reflect the records that were written to the file: </p> <div>‘<samp>AAAAAA</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>BBBBBB</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>CCCCCC</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>DDDDDD</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>EEEEEE</samp>’ </div> <p>Now, assume that another program reads this file, but describes 10-character records rather than 6. Here are the records <i>that</i> program will read: </p> <div>‘<samp>AAAAAABBBB</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>BBCCCCCCDD</samp>’ </div>
<div>‘<samp>DDDDEEEEEE</samp>’ </div> <p>There may be times where this is exactly what you were looking for. More often than not, however, this is not desirable behaviour. Suggestion: use a copybook to describe the record layouts of any file; this guarantees that multiple programs accessing that file will “see” the same record sizes and layouts by coding a <code>COPY</code> statement (see <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>) to import the record layout(s) rather than hand-coding them. </p> <p>These files <i>can</i> contain exact binary data fields. Because there is no character sequence that constitutes an end-of-record delimiter, the contents of record fields are irrelevant to the reading process. </p> </dd> <dt><code>ORGANIZATION RELATIVE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>The contents of these files consist of a series of fixed-length data records prefixed with a four-byte record header. The record header contains the length of the data, in bytes. The byte-count does not include the four-byte record header. </p> <p>Records in this type of file are all the same physical length. If variable-length logical records are defined to the program, the space occupied by each physical record in the file will occupy the maximum possible space, and the logical record length field will contain the number of bytes of data in the record that are actually in use. </p> <p>This file organization was defined to accommodate either sequential or random processing. With a <code>RELATIVE</code> file, it is possible to read or write record 100 directly, without having to have first read or written records 1-99. The GnuCOBOL runtime system uses the program-defined maximum record size to calculate a relative byte position in the file where the record header and data begin, and then transfers the necessary data to or from the program. </p> <p>When the file is written by a GnuCOBOL program, no delimiter sequence is appended to the data, but a record-length field is added to the beginning of each physical record. </p> <p>When the file is read, the data is transferred into the program exactly as it exists in the file. </p> <p>Care must be taken that programs reading such a file describe records whose length is exactly the same as that used by the programs that created the file. It won’t end well if the GnuCOBOL runtime library interprets a four-byte ASCII character string as a record length when it transfers data from the file into the program! </p> <p>Suggestion: use a copybook to describe the record layouts of any file; this guarantees that multiple programs accessing that file will “see” the same record sizes and layouts by coding a <code>COPY</code> statement (see <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>) to import the record layout(s) rather than hand-coding them. </p> <p>These files can contain exact binary data fields. The contents of record fields are irrelevant to the reading process as there is no end-of-record delimiter. </p> </dd> <dt><code>ORGANIZATION INDEXED</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>This is the most advanced file structure available to GnuCOBOL programs. It’s not possible to describe the physical structure of such files because that structure will vary depending upon which advanced file-management facility was included into the GnuCOBOL build you will be using (Berkeley Database [BDB], VBISAM, etc.). We will — instead — discuss the logical structure of the file. </p> <p>There will be multiple structures stored for an <code>INDEXED</code> file. The first will be a data component, which may be thought of as being similar to the internal structure of a relative file. Data records may not, however, be directly accessed by their record number as would be the case with a relative file, nor may they be processed sequentially by their physical sequence in the file. </p> <p>The remaining structures will be one or more index components. An index component is a data structure that (somehow) enables the contents of a field, called a primary key, within each data record (a customer number, an employee number, a product code, a name, etc.) to be converted to a record number so that the data record for any given primary key value can be directly read, written and/or deleted. Additionally, the index data structure is defined in such a manner as to allow the file to be processed sequentially, record-by-record, in ascending sequence of the primary key field values. Whether this index structure exists as a binary-searchable tree structure (b-tree), an elaborate hash structure or something else is pretty much irrelevant to the programmer — the behaviour of the structure will be as it was just described. The actual mechanism used will depend upon the advanced file-management package was included into your GnuCOBOL implementation when it was built. </p> <p>The runtime system will not allow two records to be written to an indexed file with the same primary key value. </p> <p>The capability exists for an additional field to be defined as what is known as an alternate key. Alternate key fields behave just like primary keys, allowing both direct and sequential access to record data based upon the alternate key field values, with one exception. That exception is the fact that alternate keys may be allowed to have duplicate values, depending upon how the alternate key field is described to the GnuCOBOL compiler. </p> <p>There may be any number of alternate keys, but each key field comes with a disk space penalty as well as an execution time penalty. As the number of alternate key fields increases, it will take longer and longer to write and/or modify records in the file. </p> <p>These files can contain exact binary data fields. The contents of record fields are irrelevant to the reading process as there is no end-of-record delimiter. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>All files are initially described to a GnuCOBOL program using a <code>SELECT</code> statement (see <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a>). In addition to defining a name by which the file will be referenced within the program, the <code>SELECT</code> statement will specify the name and path by which the file will be known to the operating system along with its organization, locking and sharing attributes. </p> <p>A file description in the <code>FILE SECTION</code> (see <a href="#FILE-SECTION">FILE SECTION</a>) will define the structure of records within the file, including whether or not variable-length records are possible and, if so, what the minimum and maximum length might be. In addition, the file description entry can specify file I/O block sizes. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Table-Handling">2.1.9. Table Handling</h3> <p>Other programming languages have arrays; COBOL has tables. They’re basically the same thing. There are two special statements that exist in the COBOL language — <code>SEARCH</code> and <code>SEARCH ALL</code> — that make finding data in a table easy. </p> <p><code>SEARCH</code> searches a table sequentially, stopping only when either a table entry matching one of any number of search conditions is found, or when all table entries have been checked against the search criteria and none matched any of those criteria. </p> <p><code>SEARCH ALL</code> performs an extremely fast search against a table sorted by a key field contained in each table entry. The algorithm used for such a search is a binary search. The algorithm ensures that only a small number of entries in the table need to be checked in order to find a desired entry or to determine that the desired entry doesn’t exist in the table. The larger the table, the more effective this search becomes. For example, a binary search of a table containing 32,768 entries will locate a particular entry or determine the entry doesn’t exist by looking at no more than fifteen (15) entries! The algorithm is explained in detail in the documentation of the <code>SEARCH ALL</code> statement (see <a href="#SEARCH-ALL">SEARCH ALL</a>). </p> <p>Finally, COBOL has the ability to perform in-place sorts of the data that is found in a table. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Sorting-and-Merging-Data">2.1.10. Sorting and Merging Data</h3> <p>The COBOL language includes a powerful <code>SORT</code> statement that can sort large amounts of data according to arbitrarily complex key structures. This data may originate from within the program or may be contained in one or more external files. The sorted data may be written automatically to one or more output files or may be processed, record-by-record in the sorted sequence. </p> <p>A companion statement — <code>MERGE</code> — can combine the contents of multiple files together, provided those files are all pre-sorted in a similar manner according to the same key structure. The resulting output will consist of the contents of all of the input files, merged together and sequenced according to the common key structure(s). The output generated by a <code>MERGE</code> statement may be written automatically to one or more output files or may be processed internally by the program. </p> <p>A special form of the <code>SORT</code> statement also exists just to sort the data that resides in a table. This is particularly useful if you wish to use <code>SEARCH ALL</code> against the table. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="String-Manipulation">2.1.11. String Manipulation</h3> <p>There have been programming languages designed specifically for the processing of text strings, and there have been programming languages designed for the sole purpose of performing high-powered numerical computations. Most programming languages fall somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>COBOL is no exception, although it does include some very powerful string manipulation capabilities; GnuCOBOL actually has even more string-manipulation capabilities than many other COBOL implementations.

</pre> <p>The above screen was produced by the GnuCOBOL Interactive Compiler, or GCic. See <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/gnucobsp.html#GCic">GCic</a> in <cite>GnuCOBOL Sample Programs</cite>, for the source and cross-reference listing of this program. PDF versions of this document will include an actual graphical image of this sample screen. </p> <p>Screens are defined in the screen section of the data division. Once defined, screens are used at run-time via the <code>ACCEPT</code> and <code>DISPLAY</code> statements. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="Color-Palette-and-Video-Attributes">2.1.12.2. Color Palette and Video Attributes</h3> <p>GnuCOBOL supports the following visual attribute specifications in the <code>SCREEN SECTION</code> (see <a href="#SCREEN-SECTION">SCREEN SECTION</a>): </p> <dl compact> <dt>Color</dt> <dd>
<p>Eight (8) different colors may be specified for both the background (screen) and foreground (text) color of any row/column position on the screen. Colors are specified by number, although a copybook supplied with all GnuCOBOL distributions (<samp>screenio.cpy</samp>) defines <code>COB-COLOR-<var>xxxxxx</var></code> names for the various colors so they may be specified as a more meaningful name rather than a number. The eight colors, by number, with the constant names defined in <samp>screenio.cpy</samp>, are as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>Black</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-BLACK </p> </dd> <dt><code>Blue</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-BLUE </p> </dd> <dt><code>Green</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-GREEN </p> </dd> <dt><code>Cyan</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-CYAN </p> </dd> <dt><code>Red</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-RED </p> </dd> <dt><code>Magenta</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-MAGENTA </p> </dd> <dt><code>Yellow</code></dt> <dd>
<p>COB-COLOR-YELLOW </p> </dd> <dt><code>White</code></dt> <dd><p>COB-COLOR-WHITE </p></dd> </dl> </dd> <dt>Text Brightness</dt> <dd>
<p>There are three possible brightness levels supported for text — lowlight (dim), normal and highlight (bright). Not all GnuCOBOL implementations will support all three (some treat lowlight the same as normal). The deciding factor as to whether two or three levels are supported lies with the version of the <i>curses</i> package that is being used. This is a utility screen-IO package that is included into the GnuCOBOL run-time library when the GnuCOBOL software is built. </p> <p>As a general rule of thumb, Windows implementations support two levels while Unix ones support all three. </p> </dd> <dt>Blinking</dt> <dd>
<p>This too is a video feature that is dependent upon the <i>curses</i> package built into your version of GnuCOBOL. If blinking is enabled in that package, text displayed in fields defined in the screen section as being blinking will endlessly cycle between the brightest possible setting (highlight) and an “invisible” setting where the text color matches that of the field background color. A Windows build, which generally uses the “pcurses” package, will uses a brighter-than-normal background color to signify “blinking”. </p> </dd> <dt>Reverse Video</dt> <dd>
<p>This video attribute simply swaps the foreground and background colors and display options. </p> </dd> <dt>Field Outlining</dt> <dd>
<p>It is possible, if supported by the <i>curses</i> package being used, to draw borders on the top, left and/or bottom edges of a field. </p> </dd> <dt>Secure Input</dt> <dd>
<p>If desired, screen fields used as input fields may defined as “secure” fields, where each input character (regardless of what was actually typed) will appear as an asterisk (*) character. The actual character whose key was pressed will still be stored into the field in the program, however. This is very useful for password or account number fields. </p> </dd> <dt>Prompt Character</dt> <dd><p>Input fields may have any character used as a fill character. These fill characters provide a visual indication of the size of the input field, and will automatically be transformed into spaces when the input field is processed by the program. If no such character is defined for an input field, an underscore (‘<samp>_</samp>’) will be assumed. </p></dd> </dl>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Report-Writer-Features">2.1.13. Report Writer Features</h3> <p>GnuCOBOL includes an implementation of the Report Writer Control System, or RWCS. The reportwriter module is now fully implemented as of version 3.0. This is a standardized, optional add-on feature to the COBOL language which automates much of the mechanics involved in the generation of printed reports by: </p>
<ol> <li> Controlling the pagination of reports, including: <ol> <li> The automatic production of a one-time notice on the first page of the report (report heading). </li>
<li> The production of zero or more header lines at the top of every page of the report (page heading). </li>
<li> The production of zero or more footer lines at the bottom of every page of the report (page footing). </li>
<li> The automatic numbering of printed pages. </li>
<li> The formatting of those report lines that make up the main body of the report (detail). </li>
<li> Full awareness of where the “pen” is about to “write” on the current page, automatically forcing an eject to a new page, along with the automatic generation of a page footer to close the old page and/or a page header to begin the new one. </li>
<li> The production of a one-time notice at the end of the last page of a report (report footing). </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> Performing special reporting actions based upon the fact that the data being used to generate the report has been sorted according to one or more key fields: <ol> <li> Automatically suppressing the presentation of one or more fields of data from the detail group when the value(s) of the field(s) duplicate those of the previously generated detail group. Fields such as these are referred to as group-indicate fields. </li>
<li> Automatically causing suppressed detail group-indicate fields to re-appear should a detail group be printed on a new page. </li>
<li> Recognizing when control fields on the report — fields tied to those that were used as <code>SORT</code> statement (see <a href="#SORT">SORT</a>) keys — have changed. This is known as a control break. The RWCS can automatically perform the following reporting actions when a control break occurs: <ul> <li> Producing a footer, known as a control footing after the detail lines that shared the same old value for the control field. </li>
<li> Producing a header, known as a control heading before the detail lines that share the same new value for the control field. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> Perform data summarise, as follows: <ol> <li> Automatically generating subtotals in control and/or report footings, summarizing values of any fields in the detail group. </li>
<li> Automatically generating crossfoot totals in detail groups. These would be sums of two or more values presented in the detail group. </li>
</ol> </li>
</ol> <p>The <code>REPORT SECTION</code> (see <a href="#REPORT-SECTION">REPORT SECTION</a>) documentation explores the description of reports and the <code>PROCEDURE DIVISION</code> (see <a href="#PROCEDURE-DIVISION">PROCEDURE DIVISION</a>) chapter documents the various language statements that actually produce reports. Before reading these, you might find it helpful to read <a href="#Report-Writer-Usage">Report Writer Usage</a>, which is dedicated to putting the pieces together for you. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Data-Initialization">2.1.14. Data Initialization</h3> <p>There are three ways in which data division data gets initialized. </p>
<ol> <li> When a program or subprogram is first executed, much of the data in its data division will be initialized as follows: <ul> <li> Alphanumeric and alphabetic (i.e. text) data items will be initialized to <code>SPACES</code>. </li>
<li> Numeric data items will be initialized to a value of <code>ZERO</code>. </li>
<li> Data items with an explicit <code>VALUE</code> (see <a href="#VALUE">VALUE</a>) clause in their definition will be initialized to that specific value. </li>
</ul> <p>The various sections of the data division each have their own rules as to when the actions described above will occur — consult the documentation on those sections for additional information. </p> <p>These default initialization rules can vary quite substantially from one COBOL implementation to another. For example, it is quite common for data division storage to be initialized to all binary zeros except for those data items where <code>VALUE</code> clauses are present. Take care when working with applications originally developed for another COBOL implementation to ensure that GnuCOBOL’s default initialization rules won’t prove disruptive. </p> </li>
<li> A programmer may use the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) to initialise any group or elementary data item at any time. This statement provides far more initialization options than just the simple rules stated above. </li>
<li> When the <code>ALLOCATE</code> statement (see <a href="#ALLOCATE">ALLOCATE</a>) statement is used to allocate a data item or to simply allocate an area of storage of a size specified on the <code>ALLOCATE</code>, that allocation may occur with or without initialization, as per the programmer’s needs. </li>
</ol>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Syntax-Diagram-Conventions">2.1.15. Syntax Diagram Conventions</h3> <p>Syntax of the GnuCOBOL language will be described in special <i>syntax diagrams</i> using the following syntactical-description techniques: </p> <dl compact> <dt><code>MANDATORY-RESERVED-WORD</code></dt> <dt><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Reserved words of the COBOL language will appear in UPPER-CASE. When they appear underlined, as this one is, they are required reserved words. </p> </dd> <dt><code>OPTIONAL-RESERVED-WORD</code></dt> <dd>
<p>When reserved words appear without underlining, as this one is, they are optional; such reserved words are available in the language syntax merely to improve readability — their presence or absence has no effect upon the program. </p> </dd> <dt><code>ABBREVIATION</code></dt> <dt><code>~~~~</code></dt> <dd>
<p>When only a portion of a reserved word is underlined, it indicates that the word may either be coded in its full form or may be abbreviated to the portion that is underlined. </p> </dd> <dt><code>substitutable-items</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Generic terms representing user-defined substitutable items will be shown entirely in lower-case in syntax diagrams. When such items are referenced in text, they will appear as <var>substitutable-items</var>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>Complex-Syntax-Clause</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Items appearing in Mixed Case within a syntax diagram represent complex clauses of other syntax elements that may appear in that position. Some COBOL syntax gets quite complicated, and using a convention such as this significantly reduces the complexity of a syntax diagram. When such items are referenced in text, they will appear as <var>Complex-Syntax-Clause</var>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>[ ]</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Square bracket meta characters on syntax diagrams document language syntax that is optional. The [] characters themselves should not be coded. If a syntax diagram contains ‘<samp>a [b] c</samp>’, the ‘<samp>a</samp>’ and ‘<samp>c</samp>’ syntax elements are mandatory but the ‘<samp>b</samp>’ element is optional. </p> </dd> <dt><code>|</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Vertical bar meta characters on syntax diagrams document simple choices. The | character itself should not be coded. If a syntax diagram contains ‘<samp>a|b|c</samp>’, exactly one of the items ‘<samp>a</samp>’, ‘<samp>b</samp>’ or ‘<samp>c</samp>’ must be selected. </p> </dd> <dt><code>{ xxxxxx }</code></dt> <dt><code>{ yyyyyy }</code></dt> <dt><code>{ zzzzzz }</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A vertical list of items, bounded by multiple brace characters, is another way of signifying a choice between a series of items where exactly one item must be selected. This form is used to show choices when one or more of the selections is more complex than just a single word, or when there are too many choices to present horizontally with ‘<samp>|</samp>’ meta characters. </p> </dd> <dt><code>| xxxxxx |</code></dt> <dt><code>| yyyyyy |</code></dt> <dt><code>| zzzzzz |</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A vertical list of items, bounded by multiple vertical bar characters, signifies a choice between a series of items where one <i>or more</i> of the choices could be selected. </p> </dd> <dt><code>...</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The ... meta character sequence signifies that the syntax element immediately preceding it may be repeated. The ... sequence itself should not be coded. If a syntax diagram contains <code>a b... c</code>, syntax element ‘<samp>a</samp>’ must be followed by at least one ‘<samp>b</samp>’ element (possibly more) and the entire sequence must be terminated by a ‘<samp>c</samp>’ syntax element. </p> </dd> <dt><code>{ }</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The braces (‘<samp>{</samp>’ and ‘<samp>}</samp>’) meta characters may be used to group a sequence of syntax elements together so that they may be treated as a single entity. The <code>{}</code> characters themselves should not be coded. These are typically used in combination with the ‘<samp>|</samp>’ or ‘<samp>...</samp>’ meta characters. </p> </dd> <dt><code>$*^()-+=:"'&lt;,&gt;./</code></dt> <dd><p>Any of these characters appearing within a syntax diagram are to be interpreted literally, and are characters that must be coded — where allowed — in the statement whose format is being described. Note that a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ character is a literal character that must be coded on a statement whereas a ‘<samp>...</samp>’ symbol is the meta character sequence described above. </p></dd> </dl>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Format-of-Program-Source-Lines">2.1.16. Format of Program Source Lines</h3> <p>Prior to the COBOL2002 standard, source statements in COBOL programs were structured around 80-column punched cards. This means that each source line in a COBOL program consisted of five different “areas”, defined by their column number(s). </p> <p>As of the COBOL2002 standard, a second mode now exists for COBOL source code statements — in this mode of operation, COBOL statements may each be up to 255 characters long, with no specific requirements as to what should appear in which columns. </p> <p>Of course, in keeping with the long-standing COBOL tradition of maintaining backwards compatibility with older standards, programmers (and, of course, compliant COBOL compilers) are capable of working in either mode. It is even possible to switch back and forth in the same program. The terms  <em>Fixed Format Mode</em>  and  <em>Free Format Mode</em>  are used to refer to these two modes of source code formatting. </p> <p>The GnuCOBOL compiler (cobc) supports both of these source line format modes, defaulting to Fixed Format Mode lacking any other information. </p> <p>The compiler can be instructed to operate in either mode in any of the following four ways: </p>
<ol> <li> Using a compiler option switch — use the   <samp>-fixed</samp> switch to start in Fixed Format Mode (remember that this is the default) or the   <samp>-free</samp> switch to start in Free Format Mode. </li>
<li> You may use the <code>SOURCEFORMAT AS FIXED</code> and <code>SOURCEFORMAT AS FREE</code> clauses of the <code>&gt;&gt;SET</code> CDF directive (see <a href="#g_t_003e_003eSET">&gt;&gt;SET</a>) within your source code to switch to Fixed or Free Format Mode, respectively. </li>
<li> You may use the <code>&gt;&gt;FORMAT IS FIXED</code> and <code>FORMAT IS FREE</code> clauses of the <code>&gt;&gt;DEFINE</code> CDF directive (see <a href="#g_t_003e_003eDEFINE">&gt;&gt;DEFINE</a>) within your source code to switch to Fixed or Free Format Mode, respectively. </li>
<li> You may use the <code>&gt;&gt;SOURCE</code> CDF directive (see <a href="#g_t_003e_003eSOURCE">&gt;&gt;SOURCE</a>) to switch to Free Format Mode (<code>&gt;&gt;SOURCE FORMAT IS FREE</code>) or Fixed Format Mode (<code>&gt;&gt;SOURCE FORMAT IS FIXED</code>. </li>
</ol> <p>Using methods 2-4 above, you may switch back and forth between the two formats at will. </p> <p>The last three options above are all equivalent; all three are supported by GnuCOBOL so that source code compatibility may be maintained with a wide variety of other COBOL implementations. With all three, if the compiler is <i>currently</i> in Fixed Format Mode, the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> must begin in column 8 or beyond, provided no part of the directive extends past column 72. If the compiler is currently in Free Format Mode, the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> may appear in any column, provided no part of the directive extends past column 255. </p> <p>Depending upon which source format mode the compiler is in, you will need to follow various rules for the format mode currently in effect. These rules are presented in the upcoming paragraphs. </p> <p>The following discussion presents the various components of every GnuCOBOL source line record when the compiler is operating in Fixed Format Mode. Remember that this is the default mode for the GnuCOBOL compiler. </p>
<dl compact> <dt><b>1-6</b></dt> <dd>
  <p>Sequence Number Area </p> <p>Historically, back in the days when punched-cards were used to submit COBOL program source to a COBOL compiler, this part of a COBOL statement was reserved for a six-digit sequence number. While the contents of this area are ignored by COBOL compilers, it existed so that a program actually punched on 80-character cards could — if the card deck were dropped on the floor — be run through a card sorter machine and restored to its proper sequence. Of course, this isn’t necessary today; if truth be told, it hasn’t been necessary for a long time. </p> <p>See <a href="#Marking-Changes-in-Programs">Marking Changes in Programs</a>, for discussion of a valuable use to which the sequence number area may be put today. </p> </dd> <dt><b>7</b></dt> <dd>
  <p>Indicator Area </p> <p>Column 7 serves as an indicator in which one of five possible values will appear — space, <code>D</code> (or <code>d</code>), <code>-</code> (dash), <code>/</code> or <code>*</code>. The meanings of these characters are as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt>space</dt> <dd>
<p>No special meaning — this is the normal character that will appear in this area. </p> </dd> <dt>D/d</dt> <dd>
<p>The line contains a valid GnuCOBOL statement that is normally treated as a comment unless the program is being compiled in debugging mode. </p> </dd> <dt>*</dt> <dd>
<p>The line is a comment. </p> </dd> <dt>/</dt> <dd>
<p>The line is a comment that will also force a page eject in the compilation listing. While GnuCOBOL will honour such a line as a comment, it will not form-feed any generated listing. </p> </dd> <dt>-</dt> <dd><p>The line is a continuation of the previous line. These are needed only when an alphanumeric literal (quoted character string), reserved word or user-defined word are being split across lines. </p></dd> </dl> </dd> <dt><b>8-11</b></dt> <dd>
  <p>Area A </p> <p>Language <code>DIVISION</code>, <code>SECTION</code> and paragraph section headers must b egin in Area A, as must the level numbers 01, 77 in data description entries and the <code>FD</code> and <code>SD</code> file and <code>SORT</code> description headers. </p> </dd> <dt><b>12-72</b></dt> <dd>
  <p>Area B </p> <p>All other COBOL programming language components are coded in these columns. </p> </dd> <dt><b>73-80</b></dt> <dd>
  <p>Program Name Area </p> <p>This is another obsolete area of COBOL statements. This part of every statement also hails back to the day when programs were punched on cards; it was expected that the name of the program (or at least the first 8 characters of it) would be punched here so that — if a dropped COBOL source deck contained more than one program — that handy card sorter machine could be used to first separate the cards by program name and then sort them by sequence number. Today’s COBOL compilers (including GnuCOBOL) simply ignore anything past column 72. </p> <p>See <a href="#Marking-Changes-in-Programs">Marking Changes in Programs</a>, for discussion of a valuable use to which the program name area may be put today. </p>

<ol> <li> Not all divisions are needed in every program, but they must be specified in the order shown when they <i>are</i> used. </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the identification division <ul> <li> The <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.</code> header is always optional. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the environment division: <ul> <li> If both optional sections of this division are coded, they must be coded in the sequence shown. </li>
<li> Each of these sections consists of a series of specific paragraphs (<code>SOURCE-COMPUTER</code> and <code>OBJECT-COMPUTER</code>, for example). Each of these paragraphs serves a specific purpose. If no code is required for the purpose one of the paragraphs serves, the entire paragraph may be omitted. </li>
<li> If none of the paragraphs within one of the sections are coded, the section header itself may be omitted. </li>
<li> The paragraphs within each section may only be coded in that section, but may be coded in any order. </li>
<li> If none of the sections within the environment division are coded, the <code>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.</code> header itself may be omitted. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the data division: <ul> <li> The data division consists of six optional sections — when used, those sections must be coded in the order shown in the syntax diagram. </li>
<li> Each of these sections consists of code which serves a specific purpose. If no code is required for the purpose one of those sections serves, the entire section, including its header, may be omitted. </li>
<li> If none of the sections within the data division are coded (a highly unlikely, but theoretically possible circumstance), the <code>DATA DIVISION.</code> header itself may be omitted. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the procedure division: <ul> <li> As with the other divisions, the procedure division may consist of sections and those sections may — in turn — consist of paragraphs. Unlike the other divisions, however, section and paragraph names are defined by the programmer, and there may not be any defined at all if the programmer so wishes. </li>
<li> Each Event-Handler-Routine will be a separate section devoted to trapping a particular run-time event. If there are no such sections coded, the <code>DECLARATIVES.</code> and <code>END DECLARATIVES.</code> lines may be omitted. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> A single file of COBOL source code may contain: <ul> <li> A portion of a program; these files are known as copybooks </li>
<li> A single program. In this case, the <code>END PROGRAM</code> or <code>END FUNCTION</code> statement is optional. </li>
<li> Multiple programs, separated from one another by <code>END PROGRAM</code> or <code>END FUNCTION</code> statements. The final program in such a source code file need not have an <code>END PROGRAM</code> or <code>END FUNCTION</code> statement. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> Subprogram ‘<samp>B</samp>’ may be nested inside program ‘<samp>A</samp>’ by including program B’s source code at the end of program A’s procedure division without an intervening <code>END PROGRAM A.</code> or <code>END FUNCTION A.</code> statement. For now, that’s all that will be said about nesting. See <a href="#Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">Independent vs Contained vs Nested Subprograms</a>, for more information. </li>

This is quite similar to cross-program linkage capabilities provided by other languages. In GnuCOBOL’s case, the <code>CALL</code> facility is powerful enough to be tailored to the point where a GnuCOBOL program can communicate with operating system, database management and run-time library APIs, even if they weren’t written in COBOL themselves. See <a href="#GnuCOBOL-Main-Programs-CALLing-C-Subprograms">GnuCOBOL Main Programs CALLing C Subprograms</a>, for an example of how a GnuCOBOL program could invoke a C-language subprogram, passing information back and forth between the two. </p> <p>The fact that GnuCOBOL supports a full-featured two-way interface with C-language programs means that — even if you cannot access a library API directly — you could always do so via a small C “wrapper” program that is <code>CALL</code>ed by a GnuCOBOL program. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="The-COBOL-Language-_002d-Advanced-Techniques">2.2. The COBOL Language - Advanced Techniques</h2>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Table-References">2.2.1. Table References</h3> <p>COBOL uses parenthesis to specify the subscripts used to reference table entries (tables in COBOL are what other programming languages refer to as arrays). </p> <p>For example, observe the following data structure which defines a 4 column by 3 row grid of characters: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  GRID.
     05 GRID-ROW OCCURS 3 TIMES.
        10 GRID-COLUMN OCCURS 4 TIMES.

</div> <p>If the structure contains the following grid of characters: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">A B C D
E F G H
I J K L
</pre>
</div> <p>Then <code>GRID-CHARACTER (2, 3)</code> references the ‘<samp>G</samp>’ and <code>GRID-CHARACTER (3, 2)</code> references the ‘<samp>J</samp>’. </p> <p>Subscripts may be specified as numeric (integer) literals, numeric (integer) data items, data items created with any of the picture-less integer <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) specifications, <code>USAGE INDEX</code> data items or arithmetic expressions resulting in a non-zero integer value. </p> <p>In the above examples, a comma is used as a separator character between the two subscript values; semicolons (<code>;</code>) are also valid subscript separator characters, as are spaces! The use of a comma or semicolon separator in such a situation is technically optional, but by convention most COBOL programmers use one or the other. The use of no separator character (other than a space) is not recommended, even though it is syntactically correct, as this practice can lead to programmer-unfriendly code. It isn’t too difficult to read and understand <code>GRID-CHARACTER(2 3)</code>, but it’s another story entirely when trying to comprehend <code>GRID-CHARACTER(I + 1 J / 3)</code> (instead of <code>GRID-CHARACTER(I + 1, J / 3)</code>). The compiler accepts it, but too much of this would make <i>my</i> head hurt. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Qualification-of-Data-Names">2.2.2. Qualification of Data Names</h3> <p>COBOL allows data names to be duplicated within a program, provided references to those data names may be made in such a manner as to make those references unique through a process known as qualification. </p> <p>To see qualification at work, observe the following segments of two data records defined in a COBOL program: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">01  EMPLOYEE.                     01  CUSTOMER.
    05 MAILING-ADDRESS.               05 MAILING-ADDRESS.

          15 FILLER     PIC X(4).           15 FILLER     PIC X(4).
</pre> <p>Now, let’s deal with the problem of setting the <code>CITY</code> portion of an <code>EMPLOYEE</code>s <code>MAILING-ADDRESS</code> to ‘<samp>Philadelphia</samp>’. Clearly, <code>MOVE 'Philadelphia' TO CITY</code> cannot work because the compiler will be unable to determine which of the two <code>CITY</code> fields you are referring to. </p> <p>In an attempt to correct the problem, we could qualify the reference to <code>CITY</code> as <code>MOVE 'Philadelphia' TO CITY OF MAILING-ADDRESS</code>. </p> <p>Unfortunately that too is insufficient because it still insufficiently specifies which <code>CITY</code> is being referenced. To truly identify which specific <code>CITY</code> you want, you’d have to code <code>MOVE 'Philadelphia' TO CITY OF MAILING-ADDRESS OF EMPLOYEE</code>. </p> <p>Now there can be no confusion as to which <code>CITY</code> is being changed. Fortunately, you don’t need to be quite so specific; COBOL allows intermediate and unnecessary qualification levels to be omitted. This allows <code>MOVE 'Philadelphia' TO CITY OF EMPLOYEE</code> to do the job nicely. </p> <p>If you need to qualify a reference to a table, do so by coding something like <code><var>identifier-1</var> OF <var>identifier-2</var> ( <var>subscript(s)</var> )</code>. </p> <p>The reserved word <code>IN</code> may be used in lieu of <code>OF</code>. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Reference-Modifiers">2.2.3.

</pre>   <p>Arithmetic expressions are formed using four categories of operations — exponentiation, multiplication &amp; division, addition &amp; subtraction, and sign specification. </p> <p>In complex expressions composed of multiple operators and operands, a precedence of operation applies whereby those operations having a higher precedence are computed first before operations with a lower precedence. </p> <p>As is the case in almost any other programming language, the programmer is always free to use pairs of parenthesis to enclose sub-expressions of complex expressions that are to be evaluated before other sub-expressions rather than let operator precedence dictate the sequence of evaluation. </p> <p>In highest to lowest order of precedence, here is a discussion of each category of operation: </p>
<dl compact> <dt>Level 1 (Highest) — Unary Sign Specification (<code>+</code> and <code>-</code> with a single argument)</dt> <dd>
  <p>The unary “minus” (-) operator returns the arithmetic negation of its single argument, effectively returning as its value the product of its argument and -1. </p> <p>The unary “plus” (+) operator returns the value of its single argument, effectively returning as its value the product of its argument and +1. </p>
</dd> <dt>Level 2 — Exponentiation (<code>**</code> or <code>^</code>)</dt> <dd>
  <p>The value of the left argument is raised to the power indicated by the right argument. Non-integer powers are allowed. The <code>^</code> and <code>**</code> operators are both supported to provide compatibility with programs written for other COBOL implementations. </p>
</dd> <dt>Level 3 — Multiplication (<code>*</code>) and division (<code>/</code>)</dt> <dd>
  <p>The <code>*</code> operator computes the product of the left and right arguments while the <code>/</code> operator computes the value of the left argument divided by the value of the right argument. If the right argument has a value of zero, expression evaluation will be prematurely terminated before a value is generated. This may cause program failure at run-time. </p> <p>A sequence of multiple 3rd-level operations (<code>A * B / C</code>, for example) will evaluate in strict left-to-right sequence if no parenthesis are used to control the order of evaluation. </p>
</dd> <dt>Level 4 — Addition (<code>+</code>) or subtraction (<code>+</code>)</dt> <dd>
  <p>The <code>+</code> operator calculates the sum of the left and right arguments while the <code>-</code> operator computes the value of the right argument subtracted from that of the left argument. </p> <p>A sequence of multiple 4th-level operations (<code>A - B + C</code>, for example) will evaluate in strict left-to-right sequence if no parenthesis are used to control the order of evaluation. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>The syntactical rules of COBOL, allowing a dash (-) character in data item names, can lead to some ambiguity. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  C        PIC 9 VALUE 5.

Or, will it be the number 8, which is the value of adding 1 to the value of data item <code>C-D</code> (7)? </p> <p>The right answer is 8 — the value of data item <code>C-D</code> plus 1! Hopefully, that was the intended result. </p> <p>The GnuCOBOL compiler actually went through the following decision-making logic when generating code for the <code>COMPUTE</code> Statement: </p>
<ol> <li> Is there a data item named <code>C-D</code> defined? If so, use its value for the character sequence <code>C-D</code>. </li>
<li> If there is no <code>C-D</code> data item, then are there <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> data items? If not, the <code>COMPUTE</code> statement is in error. If there are, however, then code will be generated to subtract the value of <code>D</code> from <code>C</code> and add 1 to the result. </li>
</ol> <p>Had there been at least one space to the left and/or the right of the <code>-</code>, there would have been no ambiguity — the compiler would have been forced to use the individual <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> data items. </p> <p>To avoid any possible ambiguity, as well as to improve program readability, it’s considered good COBOL programming practice to always code at least one space to both the left and right of every operator in arithmetic expressions as well as the <code>=</code> sign on a COMPUTE. </p> <p>Here are some examples of how the precedence of operations affects the results of arithmetic expressions (all examples use numeric literals, to simplify the discussion). </p> <table> <thead><tr>

Condition Names</h3> <p>These are the simplest of all conditions. Observe the following code: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">05  SHIRT-SIZE               PIC 99V9.
    88 TINY                  VALUE 0 THRU 12.5
    88 XS                    VALUE 13 THRU 13.5.
    88 S                     VALUE 14, 14.5.
    88 M                     VALUE 15, 15.5.
    88 L                     VALUE 16, 16.5.
    88 XL                    VALUE 17, 17.5.
    88 XXL                   VALUE 18, 18.5.
    88 XXXL                  VALUE 19, 19.5.
    88 VERY-LARGE            VALUE 20 THRU 99.9.
</pre>
</div> <p>The condition names <code>TINY</code>, <code>XS</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>XL</code>, <code>XXL</code>, <code>XXXL</code> and <code>VERY-LARGE</code> will have <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> values based upon the values within their parent data item (<code>SHIRT-SIZE</code>). </p> <p>A program wanting to test whether or not the current <code>SHIRT-SIZE</code> value can be classified as <code>XL</code> could have that decision coded as a combined condition (the most complex type of conditional expression), as either: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF SHIRT-SIZE = 17 OR SHIRT-SIZE = 17.5

- or -

IF SHIRT-SIZE = 17 OR 17.5

<ol> <li> The <code>NUMERIC</code> class test considers only the characters ‘<samp>0</samp>’, ‘<samp>1</samp>’, … , ‘<samp>9</samp>’ to be numeric; only a data item containing nothing but digits will pass a <code>NUMERIC</code> class test. Spaces, decimal points, commas, currency signs, plus signs, minus signs and any other characters except the digit characters will all fail <code>NUMERIC</code> class tests. </li>
<li> The <code>ALPHABETIC</code> class test considers only upper-case letters, lower-case letters and spaces to be alphabetic in nature. </li>
<li> The <code>ALPHABETIC-LOWER</code> and <code>ALPHABETIC-UPPER</code> class conditions consider only spaces and the respective type of letters to be acceptable in order to pass such a class test. </li>

<li> Only data items whose <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) is either explicitly or implicitly defined as <code>DISPLAY</code> may be used in <code>NUMERIC</code> or any of the <code>ALPHABETIC</code> class conditions. </li>
<li> Some COBOL implementations disallow the use of group items or <code>PIC A</code> items with <code>NUMERIC</code> class conditions and the use of <code>PIC 9</code> items with <code>ALPHABETIC</code> class conditions. GnuCOBOL has no such restrictions. </li>

<li> When comparing strings, the comparison is made based upon the program’s collating sequence. When the two string arguments are of unequal length, the shorter is assumed to be padded (on the right) with a sufficient number of spaces as to make the two strings of equal length. String comparisons take place on a corresponding character-by-character basis, left to right, until the <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> value for the relation test can be established. Characters are compared according to their relative position in the program’s <code>COLLATING SEQUENCE</code> (as defined in <code>SPECIAL-NAMES</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>)), <i>not</i> according to the bit-pattern values the characters have in storage. </li>

</pre>   <p>A combined condition is one that computes a <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> value from the <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> values of two other conditions (which could themselves be combined conditions). </p>
<ol> <li> If either condition has a value of <code>TRUE</code>, the result of <code>OR</code>ing the two together will result in a value of <code>TRUE</code>. <code>OR</code>ing two <code>FALSE</code> conditions will result in a value of <code>FALSE</code>. </li>
<li> In order for <code>AND</code> to yield a value of <code>TRUE</code>, both conditions must have a value of <code>TRUE</code>. In all other circumstances, <code>AND</code> produces a <code>FALSE</code> value. </li>
<li> When chaining multiple, similar conditions together with the same operator (OR/AND), and left or right arguments have common subjects, it is possible to abbreviate the program code. For example: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF ACCOUNT-STATUS = 1 OR ACCOUNT-STATUS = 2 OR ACCOUNT-STATUS = 7

</ol>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Use-of-Periods">2.2.6. Use of Periods</h3> <p>All COBOL implementations distinguish between sentences and statements in the procedure division. A  <em>Statement</em> is a single executable COBOL instruction. For example, these are all statements: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">MOVE SPACES TO Employee-Address
ADD 1 TO Record-Counter
DISPLAY "Record-Counter=" Record-Counter
</pre>
</div> <p>Some COBOL statements have a <i>scope of applicability</i> associated with them where one or more other statements can be considered to be part of or related to the statement in question. An example of such a situation might be the following, where the interest on a loan is being calculated and displayed at 4% interest if the loan balance is under $10,000, and 4.5% otherwise. (WARNING: the following code has an error!): </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF Loan-Balance &lt; 10000
    MULTIPLY Loan-Balance BY 0.04 GIVING Interest
ELSE
    MULTIPLY Loan-Balance BY 0.045 GIVING Interest
DISPLAY "Interest Amount = " Interest
</pre>
</div> <p>In this example, the <code>IF</code> statement actually has a scope that can include two sets of associated statements: one set to be executed when the <code>IF</code> (see <a href="#IF">IF</a>) condition is <code>TRUE</code>, and another if it is <code>FALSE</code>. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there’s a problem with the above. A human being looking at that code would probably infer that the <code>DISPLAY</code> (see <a href="#DISPLAY">DISPLAY</a>) statement, because of its lack of indentation, is to be executed regardless of the <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> value of the <code>IF</code> condition. Unfortunately, the compiler (any COBOL compiler) won’t see it that way because it really couldn’t care less what sort of indentation, if any, is used. In fact, any COBOL compiler would be just as happy to see the code written like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF Loan-Balance &lt; 10000 MULTIPLY Loan-balance
BY 0.04 GIVING Interest ELSE MULTIPLY
Loan-Balance BY 0.045 GIVING Interest DISPLAY
"Interest Amount = " Interest
</pre>
</div> <p>How then do we inform the compiler that the <code>DISPLAY</code> statement is outside the scope of the <code>IF</code>? </p> <p>That’s where sentences come in. </p> <p>A COBOL  <em>Sentence</em> is defined as any arbitrarily long sequence of statements, followed by a period (.) character. The period character is what terminates the scope of a set of statements. Therefore, our example should have been coded like this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF Loan-Balance &lt; 10000
    MULTIPLY Loan-Balance BY 0.04 GIVING Interest
ELSE
    MULTIPLY Loan-Balance BY 0.045 GIVING Interest.
DISPLAY "Interest Amount = " Interest
</pre>
</div> <p>See the period at the end of the second <code>MULTIPLY</code> (see <a href="#MULTIPLY">MULTIPLY</a>)? That is what terminates the scope of the <code>IF</code>, thus making the <code>DISPLAY</code> statement’s execution completely independent of the <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> status of the <code>IF</code>. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Use-of-VERB_002fEND_002dVERB-Constructs">2.2.7. Use of VERB/END-VERB Constructs</h3> <p>Prior to the 1985 COBOL standard, using a period character was the only way to signal the end of a statement’s scope. </p> <p>Unfortunately, this caused some problems. Take a look at this code: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF A = 1
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A &amp; B = 1"
ELSE *&gt; This ELSE has a problem!
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A NOT = 1 BUT B = 1"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NEITHER A NOR B = 1".
</pre>
</div> <p>The problem with this code is that indentation — so critical to improving the human-readability of a program — can provide an erroneous view of the logical flow. An <code>ELSE</code> is always associated with the most-recently encountered <code>IF</code>; this means the emphasized <code>ELSE</code> will be associated with the <code>IF B = 1</code> statement, not the <code>IF A = 1</code> statement as the indentation would appear to imply. </p> <p>This sort of problem led to a band-aid solution being added to the COBOL language: the <code>NEXT SENTENCE</code> clause: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF A = 1
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A &amp; B = 1"
    ELSE
        NEXT SENTENCE
ELSE
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A NOT = 1 BUT B = 1"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NEITHER A NOR B = 1".
</pre>
</div> <p><code>NEXT SENTENCE</code> informs the compiler that if the <code>B = 1</code> condition is false, control should fall into the first statement that follows the next period. </p> <p>With the 1985 standard for COBOL, a much more elegant solution was introduced. Any COBOL  <em>Verb</em> (the first reserved word of a statement) that needed such a thing was allowed to use an <code>END-<var>verb</var></code> construct to end its scope without disrupting the scope of any other statement it might have been in. Any COBOL 85 compiler would have allowed the following solution to our problem: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF A = 1
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A &amp; B = 1"
    END-IF
ELSE
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A NOT = 1 BUT B = 1"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NEITHER A NOR B = 1".
</pre>
</div> <p>This new facility made the period almost obsolete, as our program segment would probably be coded like this today: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IF A = 1
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A &amp; B = 1"
    END-IF
ELSE
    IF B = 1
        DISPLAY "A NOT = 1 BUT B = 1"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NEITHER A NOR B = 1"
    END-IF
END-IF
</pre>
</div> <p>COBOL (GnuCOBOL included) still requires that each procedure division paragraph contain at least one sentence if there is any executable code in that paragraph, but a popular coding style is now to simply code a single period right before the end of each paragraph. </p> <p>The standard for the COBOL language shows the various <code>END-<var>verb</var></code> clauses are optional because using a period as a scope-terminator remains legal. </p> <p>If you will be porting existing code over to GnuCOBOL, you’ll find it an accommodating facility capable of conforming to whatever language and coding standards that code is likely to use. If you are creating new GnuCOBOL programs, however, I would strongly counsel you to use the <code>END-<var>verb</var></code> structures in those programs. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Concurrent-Access-to-Files">2.2.8. Concurrent Access to Files</h3> <p>The manipulation of data files is one of the COBOL language’s great strengths. There are features built into COBOL to deal with the possibility that multiple programs may be attempting to access the same file concurrently. Multiple program concurrent access is dealt with in two ways — file sharing and record locking. </p> <p>Not all GnuCOBOL implementations support file sharing and record-locking options. Whether they do or not depends upon the operating system they were built for and the build options that were used when the specific GnuCOBOL implementation was generated. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="File-Sharing">2.2.8.1. File Sharing</h3> <p>GnuCOBOL controls concurrent-file access at the highest level through the concept of file sharing, enforced when a program attempts to open a file. This is accomplished via a UNIX operating-system routine called <code>fcntl</code>. That module is not currently supported by Windows and is not present in the MinGW Unix-emulation package. GnuCOBOL builds created using a MinGW environment will be incapable of supporting file-sharing controls — files will always be shared in such environments. A GnuCOBOL build created using the Cygwin environment on Windows <i>would</i> have access to <code>fcntl</code> and therefore <i>will</i> support file sharing. Of course, actual Unix builds of GnuCOBOL, as well as OSX builds, should have no issues because <code>fcntl</code> should be available. </p> <p>Any limitations imposed on a successful <code>OPEN</code> (see <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a>) will remain in place until your program either issues a <code>CLOSE</code> (see <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a>) against the file or the program terminates. </p> <p>File sharing is controlled through the use of a <code>SHARING</code> clause: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    SHARING WITH { ALL OTHER }
    ~~~~~~~      { ~~~       }
                 { NO OTHER  }
                 { ~~        }
                 { READ ONLY }
                   ~~~~ ~~~~
</pre> <p>This clause may be used either in the file’s <code>SELECT</code> statement (see <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a>), on the <code>OPEN</code> statement (see <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a>) which initiates your program’s use of the file, or both. If a <code>SHARING</code> option is specified in <i>both</i> places, the specifications made on the <code>OPEN</code> statement will take precedence over those from the <code>SELECT</code> statement. </p> <p>Here are the meanings of the three options: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>ALL OTHER</code></dt> <dd>
<p>When your program opens a file with this sharing option in effect, no restrictions will be placed on other programs attempting to <code>OPEN</code> the file after your program did. This is the default sharing mode. </p> </dd> <dt><code>NO OTHER</code></dt> <dd>
<p>When your program opens a file with this sharing option in effect, your program announces that it is unwilling to allow any other program to have any access to the file as long as you are using that file; <code>OPEN</code> attempts made in other programs will fail with a file status of 37 (<code>PERMISSION DENIED</code>) until such time as you <code>CLOSE</code> (see <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a>) the file. </p> </dd> <dt><code>READ ONLY</code></dt> <dd><p>Opening a file with this sharing option indicates you are willing to allow other programs to <code>OPEN</code> the file for input while you have it open. If they attempt any other <code>OPEN</code>, theirs will fail with a file status of 37. Of course, your program may fail if someone else got to the file first and opened it with a sharing option that imposed file-sharing limitations. </p></dd> </dl> <p>If the <code>SELECT</code> of a file is coded with a <code>FILE STATUS</code> clause, <code>OPEN</code> failures — including those induced by sharing failures — will be detectable by the program and a graceful recovery (or at least a graceful termination) will be possible. If no such clause was coded, however, a runtime message will be issued and the program will be terminated. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Record-Locking">2.2.8.2. Record Locking</h3> <p>Record-locking is supported by advanced file-management software built-in to the GnuCOBOL implementation you are using. This software provides a single point-of-control for access to files — usually <code>ORGANIZATION INDEXED</code> files. One such runtime package capable of doing this is the Berkeley Database (BDB) package — a package frequently used in GnuCOBOL builds to support indexed files. </p> <p>The various I/O statements your program can execute are capable of imposing limitations on access by other concurrently-executing programs to the file record they just accessed. These limitations are syntactically imposed by placing a lock on the record using a <code>LOCK</code> clause.

<ol> <li> If the GnuCOBOL build you are using was configured to use the Berkeley Database (BDB) package for indexed file I/O, record locking will be available by using the   <code>DB_HOME</code> run-time environment variable. </li>
<li> If the <code>SELECT</code> (see <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a>) statement or file <code>OPEN</code> (see <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a>) specifies <code>SHARING WITH NO OTHER</code>, record locking will be disabled. </li>
<li> If the file’s <code>SELECT</code> contains a <code>LOCK MODE IS AUTOMATIC</code> clause, every time a record is read from the file, that record is automatically locked. Other programs may access <i>other</i> records within the file, but not a locked record. </li>
<li> If the file’s <code>SELECT</code> contains a <code>LOCK MODE IS MANUAL</code> clause, locks are placed on records <i>only</i> when a <code>READ</code> statement executed against the file includes a <code>LOCK</code> clause (this clause will be discussed shortly). </li>
<li> If the <code>LOCK ON</code> clause <i>is</i> specified in the file’s <code>SELECT</code>, locks (either automatically or manually acquired) will continue to accumulate as more and more records are read, until they are explicitly released. This is referred to as  <em>multiple record locking</em>. <p>Locks acquired vie multiple record locking remain in-effect until the program holding the lock… </p>
<ul> <li> …terminates, or … </li>
<li> …executes a <code>CLOSE</code> statement (see <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a>) against the file, or … </li>
<li> …executes an <code>UNLOCK</code> statement (see <a href="#UNLOCK">UNLOCK</a>) against the file, or … </li>
<li> …executes a <code>COMMIT</code> statement (see <a href="#COMMIT">COMMIT</a>) or … </li>
<li> …executes a <code>ROLLBACK</code> statement (see <a href="#ROLLBACK">ROLLBACK</a>). </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> If the  <code>LOCK ON</code> clause is <i>not</i> specified, then the next I/O statement your program executes, except for <code>START</code> (see <a href="#START">START</a>), will release the lock. This is referred to as  <em>single record locking</em>. </li>
<li> A <code>LOCK</code> clause, which may be coded on a <code>READ</code> (see <a href="#READ">READ</a>), <code>REWRITE</code> (see <a href="#REWRITE">REWRITE</a>) or <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>) looks like this: <pre class="verbatim">    { IGNORING LOCK    }

    { WITH WAIT        }
           ~~~~
</pre> <p>The <code>WITH [ NO ] LOCK</code> option is the only one available to <code>REWRITE</code> or <code>WRITE</code> statements. </p> <p>The meanings of the various record locking options are as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>IGNORING LOCK</code></dt> <dt>WITH IGNORE LOCK</dt> <dd>
 <p>These options (which are synonymous) inform GnuCOBOL that any locks held by other programs should be ignored. </p> </dd> <dt><code>WITH LOCK</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Access to the record by other programs will be denied. </p> </dd> <dt><code>WITH NO LOCK</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The record will not be locked. This is the default for all statements. </p> </dd> <dt><code>WITH KEPT LOCK</code></dt> <dd>
<p>When single record locking is in effect, as a new record is accessed, locks held for previous records are released. By using this option, not only is the newly accessed record locked (as <code>WITH LOCK</code> would do), but prior record locks will be retained as well. A subsequent <code>READ</code> without the <code>KEPT LOCK</code> option will release all “kept” locks, as will the <code>UNLOCK</code> statement. </p> </dd> <dt><code>WITH WAIT</code></dt> <dd>
<p>This option informs GnuCOBOL that the program is willing to wait for a lock held (by another program) on the record being read to be released. </p> <p>Without this option, an attempt to read a locked record will be immediately aborted and a file status of 51 will be returned. </p> <p>With this option, the program will wait for a preconfigured time for the lock to be released. If the lock is released within the preconfigured wait time, the read will be successful. If the preconfigured wait time expires before the lock is released, the read attempt will be aborted and a 51 file status will be issued. </p>

CDF - Compiler Directing Facility</h2>  <p>The Compiler Directing Facility, or CDF, is a means of controlling the compilation of GnuCOBOL programs.

This is accomplished via a series of special CDF statements and directives that will appear in the program source code. </p> <p>When the compiler is operating in Fixed Format Mode, all CDF statements must begin in column eight (8) or beyond. </p> <p>There are two types of supported CDF statements in GnuCOBOL — Text Manipulation Statements and Compiler Directives. </p> <p>The CDF text manipulation statements <code>COPY</code> and <code>REPLACE</code> are used to introduce new code into programs either with or without changes, or may be used to modify existing statements already in the program.

<li> A <b>Type Clause</b> may be coded only when  <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> is specified. If one is coded, either <code>COMMON</code>, <code>COMMON INITIAL</code> or <code>COMMON RECURSIVE</code> must be specified. </li>
<li> While the actual <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code> or <code>ID DIVISION</code> header is optional, the <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> /  <code>FUNCTION-ID</code> paragraphs are not; only one or the other, however, may be coded. </li>
<li> The compiler’s   <samp>-Wobsolete</samp> switch will cause the GnuCOBOL compiler to issue warnings messages if these (or any other obsolete syntax) is used in a program. </li>
<li> If specified, <var>literal-1</var> must be an actual alphanumeric literal and may not be a figurative constant. </li>
<li> The <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> and <code>FUNCTION-ID</code> paragraphs serve to identify the program to the external (i.e. operating system) environment.

<li> The  <code>INITIAL</code> clause, if specified, guarantees the subprogram will be in its initial (i.e. compiled) state each and every time it is executed, not just the first time. </li>

<li> The  <code>CALL-CONVENTION</code> clause allows a decimal integer, representing a series of ON/OFF switch settings, to be associated with a mnemonic name which may then be coded on a <code>CALL</code> statement (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>). The switch settings defined by this mnemonic will then control how the linkage to a subroutine invoked by the <code>CALL</code> statement that references <var>mnemonic-name-1</var> will be handled. </li>
<li> The  <code>CONSOLE IS CRT</code> clause, if specified, will cause a <code>DISPLAY</code> statement lacking an explicit <code>UPON</code> clause to be treated as a <code>DISPLAY screen-data-item</code> statement (see <a href="#DISPLAY-screen_002ddata_002ditem">DISPLAY screen-data-item</a>), and any <code>ACCEPT</code> statement lacking a <code>FROM</code> clause to be treated as a <code>ACCEPT screen-data-item</code> statement (see <a href="#ACCEPT-screen_002ddata_002ditem">ACCEPT screen-data-item</a>). </li>
<li> If the  <code>CRT STATUS</code> clause is not specified, an implicit  <code>COB-CRT-STATUS</code> identifier (with a <code>PICTURE 9(4)</code>) will be allocated for the purpose of receiving screen <code>ACCEPT</code> statuses. If <code>CRT STATUS</code> is specified, then <var>identifier-1</var> must be defined in the program as a <code>PICTURE 9(4)</code> field. </li>
<li> The  <code>CURRENCY SIGN</code> clause may be used to redefine the character to be used as a currency sign in a <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) clause. The default currency sign is a dollar-sign (‘<samp>$</samp>’). You may specify any character <i>except</i> <code>0</code>-<code>9</code>, <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code>, <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>\\</code>, quote (‘<samp>"</samp>’) or space. </li>
<li> The  <code>CURSOR IS</code> clause allows you to specify a 4- or 6-character data item into which the cursor screen location at the time a screen <code>ACCEPT</code> is satisfied. The value will be returned as <i>rrcc</i> or <i>rrrccc</i>, depending upon the length of the specified <var>identifier-2</var>, where <i>rr</i> and <i>rrr</i> represent the row number (starting at zero) and <i>cc</i> and <i>ccc</i> represent the column number (also starting at zero). There is no default data item allocated for this data if the <code>CURSOR IS</code> clause is not specified, and it is the programmer’s responsibility to define <var>identifier-2</var> if the clause is specified. </li>
<li> The  <code>DECIMAL POINT IS COMMA</code> clause reverses the definition of the ‘<samp>,</samp>’ and ‘<samp>.</samp>’ characters when they are used as <code>PICTURE</code> editing symbols and within numeric literals. This can have unwanted side-effects - see <a href="#Punctuation">Punctuation</a>. </li>
<li> The  <code>LOCALE</code> clause may be used to associate external OS-defined locale names (<var>literal-2</var>) with an internal name (<var>locale-name-1</var>) that may then be referenced within the program. Locale names are defined by the Operating System and/or C compiler GnuCOBOL will be utilizing on your computer. </li>

Once a channel position has been assigned a mnemonic name, statements of the form <code>WRITE <var>record-name</var> AFTER ADVANCING <var>mnemonic-name-3</var></code> may be coded to write the specified print record at the channel position assigned to <var>mnemonic-name-3</var>. <p>Printers supporting channel positioning are generally mainframe-type line printers. When writing to printers that do not support channel positioning, a formfeed will be issued to the printer. </p> <p>The <code>CSP</code> positioning option stands for “No Spacing”. Testing on a MinGW build of GnuCOBOL shows that this too results in a formfeed being issued. </p>

</pre> <p>The  <code>COLLATING SEQUENCE</code>,  <code>RECORD DELIMITER</code>,  <code>RESERVE</code> and  <code>ALL OTHER</code> clauses are syntactically recognized but are otherwise non-functional. </p> <p>The <code>SELECT</code> statement creates a definition of a file and links that COBOL definition to the external operating system environment. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>AREAS</code>, <code>IS</code>, <code>MODE</code>, <code>OTHER</code>, <code>SEQUENCE</code>, <code>TO</code>, <code>USING</code> and <code>WITH</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> After <var>file-name-1</var>, the various clauses may be coded in any sequence. </li>
<li> A period must follow the last coded clause. </li>
<li> The  <code>OPTIONAL</code> clause, to be used only for files that will be used to provide input data to the program, indicates the file may or may not actually be available at run-time. Attempts to <code>OPEN</code> an <code>OPTIONAL</code> file when the file does not exist will receive a special non-fatal file status value (see status 05 in the list of file status values below) indicating the file is not available; a subsequent attempt to <code>READ</code> that file will return an <code>AT END</code> (end-of-file) condition. Optionally, files may be designated as <code>NOT OPTIONAL</code>, if desired. This is useful when specifying the compiler’s   <samp>-foptional-file</samp> switch, which automatically makes all files <code>OPTIONAL</code> except for those explicitly declared as <code>NOT OPTIONAL</code>. </li>
<li> The <var>file-name-1</var> value that you specify will be the name by which you will reference the file within your program. This name should be formed according to the rules for user-defined names (see <a href="#User_002dDefined-Words">User-Defined Words</a>). </li>
<li> The optional <code>ASSIGN</code> clause specifies how — at runtime, when <var>file-name-1</var> is opened — either a logical device (<code>STDIN</code>, <code>STDOUT</code>) or a file anywhere in one of the currently-mounted file systems will be associated with <var>file-name-1</var>, as follows: <ol> <li> There are three components to the <code>ASSIGN</code> clause: <dl compact> <dt><code><var>Type</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>EXTERNAL</code>, <code>DYNAMIC</code> or neither </p> </dd> <dt><code><var>Device</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p>the list of device choices </p> </dd> <dt><code><var>Locator</var></code></dt> <dd><p>shown as a choice between <var>identifier-1</var>, <var>word-1</var> and <var>literal-1</var>. </p></dd> </dl> </li>
<li> <code>ASSIGN TO DISC <var>file-name-1</var></code> will be assumed if there is no <code>ASSIGN</code> clause on a <code>SELECT</code>. </li>
<li> If an <code>ASSIGN</code> clause is coded without a <var>Device</var>, the device <code>DISC</code> will be assumed. </li>
<li> If a <var>Locator</var> clause is coded, the COBOL file <var>file-name-1</var> will be attached to a data file within any file system that is mounted and available to the executing program at the time <var>file-name-1</var> is opened. How that file is identified varies, depending upon the specified <var>Locator</var>, as follows: <ol> <li> If <var>literal-1</var> is coded, the value of the literal will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file. </li>
<li> If <var>identifier-1</var> is coded, the value of the identifier will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file. </li>
<li> If <var>word-1</var> (a syntactically valid word not duplicating a reserved or user-defined word) is coded, and a <var>Type</var> is <code>EXTERNAL</code>, then <var>word-1</var> itself will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file. If, however, a <var>Type</var> of <code>EXTERNAL</code> was <i>not</i> specified, the compiler will create a <code>PIC X(1024)</code> data item named <var>word-1</var> within the program; the contents of that data item at the time the program opens <var>file-name-1</var> will then serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file. </li>
<li> File Location Strings will be discussed shortly. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If no <var>Locator</var> is coded, <var>file-name-1</var> will be attached to a logical device or a file based upon the specified (or implied) <var>Device</var>, as follows: <ol> <li> <code>DISC</code> or <code>DISK</code> will assume an attachment to a file named <var>file-name-1</var> in whatever directory is current at the time the file is opened. </li>
<li> <code>DISPLAY</code> will assume an attachment to the <code>STDOUT</code> logical device; these files should only be used for output. </li>
<li> <code>KEYBOARD</code> will assume an attachment to the <code>STDIN</code> logical device; these files should only be used for input. </li>
<li> <code>PRINTER</code> will assume an attachment to the <code>LPT1</code> logical device/port; these files should only be used for output. </li>
<li> <code>RANDOM</code> or <code>TAPE</code> will behave exactly as <code>DISC</code> does. These two additional <var>Device</var>s are provided to facilitate the compilation of COBOL source from other COBOL implementations. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The <code>LINE ADVANCING</code> device <i>requires</i> that a <var>Locator</var> be specified; these files should only be used for output. A COBOL Line Advancing file will allow carriage-control characters such as line-feeds and form-feeds to be written to the attached operating system file, via the <code>ADVANCING</code> clause of the <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>). </li>
<li> File Location Strings are used (at runtime) to identify the path and filename to the data file that must be attached to <var>file-name-1</var> when that file is opened. </li>
<li> If the compiler <i>configuration file</i> (see <a href="#Compiler-Configuration-Files">Compiler Configuration Files</a>) you used to compile the program with had a <code>filename-mapping</code> value of <code>yes</code>, the GnuCOBOL runtime system will first attempt to identify a currently-defined environment variable whose value will serve as the data file’s path and filename, as follows: <ol> <li> If the compiler <i>configuration file</i> (see <a href="#Compiler-Configuration-Files">Compiler Configuration Files</a>) (see <a href="#Compiler-Configuration-Files">Compiler Configuration Files</a>) you used to compile the program specified <code>mf</code> as the <code>assign-clause</code> value, then the File Locator String will be interpreted according to Microfocus COBOL rules — namely, everything before the last ‘<samp>-</samp>’ in the File Locator String will be ignored; the characters after the last ‘<samp>-</samp>’ will be treated as the base of an environment variable name. If there is no ‘<samp>-</samp>’ character in the File Locator String then the entire File Locator String will serve as the base of an environment variable name. This is the default behaviour for every config file except <code>ibm</code>. </li>
<li> If, on the other hand, the compiler <i>configuration file</i> (see <a href="#Compiler-Configuration-Files">Compiler Configuration Files</a>) you used to compile the program specified <code>mf</code> as the <code>assign-clause</code> value, then the File Locator String will be interpreted according to according to IBM COBOL rules — namely, the File Locator String is expected to be of the form <code>S-<var>xxx</var></code> or <code>AS-<var>xxx</var></code>, in which case the <var>xxx</var> will be treated as the base of an environment variable name. If there is no ‘<samp>-</samp>’ character in the File Locator String then the entire File Locator String will serve as the base of an environment variable name. </li>
<li> Once an environment variable name base (let’s refer to it as <code><var>bbbb</var></code>) has been determined, the runtime system will look for the first one of the following environment variables that exists, in this sequence: <div class="display"> <pre class="display"><code>DD_<var>bbbb</var></code>
<code>dd_<var>bbbb</var></code>
<code><var>bbbb</var></code>
</pre>
</div> <p>Windows systems are case-insensitive with regard to environment variables, so there is no difference between the first two when using a GnuCOBOL implementation built for either Windows/MinGW or native Windows. </p> <p>If an environment variable was found, its value will serve as the path and filename to the data file. </p>
</li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If no environment variable was found, or the <i>configuration file</i> (see <a href="#Compiler-Configuration-Files">Compiler Configuration Files</a>) used to compile the program had a <code>filename-mapping</code> value of <code>NO</code>, then the File Locator String value will serve as the path and filename to the data file. </li>
<li> Paths and file names may be specified on an absolute (<code>C:\\Data\\datafile.dat</code>, <code>/Data/datafile.dat</code>, …) or relative to the current directory (<code>Data\\datafile.dat</code>, <code>Data/datafile.dat</code>, …) basis. If no directory name is included (<code>datafile.dat</code>), the file must be in the current directory. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The  <code>FILE STATUS</code> or  <code>SORT STATUS</code> clause (they are both equivalent and only one or the other, if any, should be specified) is used to specify the name of a two-digit numeric data item into which an I/O status code will be saved after every I/O verb that is executed against the file. This does not actually allocate the data item — you must define the item yourself somewhere in the data division. Note that the following list is not definitive: more can be added and any tests should include one for non zeros as a catch all.  Possible status codes that can be returned to a <code>FILE STATUS</code> data item are as follows: <div class="definitions"> <dl compact> <dt><code>00</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Success </p> </dd> <dt><code>02</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Success (Duplicate Record Key Written) </p> </dd> <dt><code>04</code></dt> <dd>

</pre>  <p>Indexed files, like relative files, may have their records processed in either a sequential or random manner. Unlike relative files, however, the actual location of a record in an indexed file is calculated automatically based upon the value(s) of one or more alphanumeric fields within records of the file. For example, an indexed file containing product data might use the product identification code as a record key. This means you may read, write or update the <code>A6G4328</code><sup>th</sup> record or the <code>Z8X7723</code><sup>th</sup> record directly, based upon the product id value of those records! </p>

Data Definition Principles</h2> <p>GnuCOBOL data items, like those of other COBOL implementations, are described in a hierarchical manner.

Take for example, the following logical layout of a portion of a data item named <code>Employee</code>: </p> <pre class="verbatim">                           Employee
                               |                     Additional

                                   :----:----:     :----:----:

                                 Year Month Day  Year Month Day
</pre> <p>The <code>Employee</code> data item consists of two subordinate data items — an <code>Employee-Name</code> and an <code>Employment-Dates</code> data item (presumably there would be a lot of others too, but we don’t care about them right now). As the diagram shows, each of those data items are, in turn, broken down into subordinate data items. This hierarchy of data items can get rather <code>deep</code>, and GnuCOBOL, like other COBOL implementations, can handle up to 49 levels of such hierarchical structures. </p> <p>As was presented earlier (see <a href="#Structured-Data">Structured Data</a>), a data item that is broken down into other data items is referred to as a group item, while one that isn’t broken down is called an elementary item. </p> <p>COBOL uses the concept of a <i>level</i> number to indicate the level at which a data item occurs in a data structure such as the example shown above. When these data items are defined, they are all defined together with a number in the range 1-49 specified in front of their names. Over the years, a convention has come to exist among COBOL programmers that level numbers are always coded as two-digit numbers — they don’t <i>need</i> to be specified as two-digit numbers, but every example you see in this document will take that approach! </p> <p>The data item at the top, also referred to as a <i>record</i>, always has a level number of 01. After that, you may assign level numbers as you wish (01–02–03–04…, 01–05–10–15…, etc.), as long as you follow these simple rules: </p>
<ol> <li> Every data item at the same <i>level</i> of a hierarchy diagram such as the one you see here (if you were to make one, which you rarely will, if ever, once you get used to this concept) must have the same level number. </li>
<li> Every new level uses a level number that is strictly greater than the one used in the parent (next higher) level. </li>
<li> When describing data hierarchies, you may never use a level number greater than 49 (except for 66, 77, 78 and 88 which have very special meanings (see <a href="#Special-Data-Items">Special Data Items</a>). </li>
</ol> <p>So, the definition of these data items in a GnuCOBOL program would go something like this: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    01  Employee
        05 Employee-Name
           10 Last-Name
           10 First-Name
           10 Middle-Initial
        05 Employment-Dates
           10 From-Date
              15 Year
              15 Month
              15 Day
           10 To-Date
              15 Year
              15 Month
              15 Day
</pre> <p>The indentation is purely at the discretion of the programmer to make things easier for humans to read (the compiler couldn’t care less). Historically, COBOL implementations that required Fixed Format Mode source programs required that the <code>01</code> level number begin in Area A and that everything else begins in Area B. GnuCOBOL only requires that all data definition syntax occur in columns 8-72. In Free Format Mode, of course, there aren’t even those limitations. </p> <p>Did you notice that there are two each of <code>Year</code>, <code>Month</code> and <code>Day</code> data names defined? That’s perfectly legal, provided that each can be uniquely <code>qualified</code> so as to be distinct from the other. Take for example the <code>Year</code> items. One is defined as part of the <code>From-Date</code> data item while the other is defined as part of the <code>To-Date</code> data item. In COBOL, we would actually code references to these two data items as either <code>Year OF From-Date</code> and <code>Year OF To-Date</code> or <code>Year IN From-Date</code> and <code>Year IN To-Date</code> (COBOL allows either <code>IN</code> or <code>OF</code> to be used). Since these references would clarify any confusion to us as to which <code>Year</code> might be referenced, the GnuCOBOL compiler won’t be confused either. </p> <p>The coding example shown above is incomplete; it only describes the data item names and their hierarchical relationships to one other. In addition, any valid data item definitions will also need to describe what type of data is to be contained in a data item (Numeric? Alphanumeric? Alphabetic?), how much data can be held in the data item and a multitude of other characteristics. </p> <p>When group items are being defined, subordinate items may be assigned the “name”  <code>FILLER</code>. There may be any number of <code>FILLER</code> items defined within a group item. A data item named <code>FILLER</code> cannot be referenced directly; these items are generally used to specify an unused portion of the total storage allocated to a group item. Note that it is possible that the name of the group item itself might be specified as <code>FILLER</code> if there is no need to ever refer directly to the group structure itself. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="FILE-SECTION">6.2.

<li> The <code>LINAGE</code> clause may only be specified in the <code>FD</code> of a sequential or line sequential file.

<li> This page structure — once defined — can be automatically enforced by the <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>). </li>
<li> Specifying a <code>LINAGE</code> clause in an <code>FD</code> will cause the   <code>LINAGE-COUNTER</code> special register to be created for the file.

<li> The  <code>RECORD CONTAINS</code> and  <code>RECORD IS VARYING</code> clauses are ignored (with a warning message issued) when used with line sequential files.

<li> If a <code>LINAGE</code> clause is also specified, Values specified for <code>LINAGE IS</code> and <code>FOOTING AT</code> will be ignored. The values of <code>LINES AT BOTTOM</code> and <code>LINES AT TOP</code>, if any, will be honoured. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following special rules apply only to sort/merge work files: <ol> <li> Sort/merge work files should be assigned to <code>DISK</code> (or <code>DISC</code>) on their <code>SELECT</code> statements. </li>
<li> Sorts and merges will be performed in memory, if the amount of data being sorted allows. </li>
<li> Should actual disk work files be necessary due to the amount of data being sorted or merged, they will be automatically allocated to disk in a folder defined by: <ul> <li> The   <code>TMPDIR</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) </li>
<li> The   <code>TMP</code> run-time environment variable </li>
<li> The   <code>TEMP</code> run-time environment variable </li>
</ul> <p>(in that order). </p> </li>
<li> These disk files will be automatically purged upon <code>SORT</code> or <code>MERGE</code> termination.

   ~~~~~</pre> <p>The <code>LEFT</code> and <code>RIGHT</code> (SYNCRONIZED) clauses are syntactically recognized but are otherwise non-functional. </p>  <p>Every sort file description (<code>SD</code> or <code>FD</code>) must be followed by at least one 01-level data item, except for file descriptions containing the <code>REPORT IS</code> clause. These 01-level data items, in turn, may be broken down into subordinate group and elementary items. An 01-level data item defined here in the file section is also known as a  <em>Record</em>, even if it is an elementary item, provided that elementary item lacks the  <code>CONSTANT</code> attribute. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>BY</code>, <code>IS</code>, <code>KEY</code>, <code>ON</code> and <code>WHEN</code> are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The reserved words <code>SYNCRONIZED</code> and <code>SYNCRONIZED</code> are interchangeable. Both may be abbreviated to <code>SYNC</code>. </li>
<li> The reserved word <code>PICTURE</code> may be abbreviated to <code>PIC</code>. </li>
<li> As the syntax diagram shows, the definition of a <var>FILE-SECTION-Data-Item</var> is a recursive one in that there may be any number of such specifications coded following a FD or SD. The first such specification must have a level number of 01, and will describe a specific format of data record within the file. Specifications that follow that one may have level numbers greater than 01, in which case they are defining a hierarchical breakdown of the record. The definition of a record is terminated when one of the following occurs: <dl compact> <dt>Another 01-level item is found</dt> <dd>
<p>signifies the start of another record layout for the file. </p> </dd> <dt>Another <code>FD</code> or <code>SD</code> is found</dt> <dd>
<p>marks the completion of the detailed description of the file and begins another. </p> </dd> <dt>A division or section header is found</dt> <dd><p>also marks the completion of the detailed description of the file and signifies the end of the file section as well. </p></dd> </dl> </li>
<li> Every FILE-SECTION-Data-Item description must be terminated with a period. </li>
<li> If there are multiple record descriptions present for a given <code>FD</code> or <code>SD</code>, the one with the longest length will define the size of the record buffer into which a <code>READ</code> statement (see <a href="#READ">READ</a>) or a <code>RETURN</code> statement (see <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>) will deliver data read from the file and from which a <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>) or <code>RELEASE</code> statement (see <a href="#RELEASE">RELEASE</a>) statement will obtain the data to be written to the file. </li>
<li> The various 01-level record descriptions for a file description implicitly share that one common record buffer (thus, they provide different ways to view the structure of data that can exist within the file). Record buffers can be shared between files by using the <code>SAME RECORD AREA</code> (see <a href="#SAME-RECORD-AREA">SAME RECORD AREA</a>) clause. </li>
<li> The only valid level numbers are 01-49, 66, 77, 78 and 88. Level numbers 66, 77, 78 and 88 all have special uses — See <a href="#Special-Data-Items">Special Data Items</a>, for details. </li>
<li> Not specifying an <var>identifier-1</var> or <code>FILLER</code> immediately after the level number has the same effect as if <code>FILLER</code> were specified. A data item named <code>FILLER</code> cannot be referenced directly; these items are generally used to specify an unused portion of the total storage allocated to a group item or to describe a group item whose contents which will only be referenced using the names of those items that belong to it. </li>
<li> <code>EXTERNAL</code> cannot be combined with <code>GLOBAL</code> or <code>REDEFINES</code>. </li>
<li> File section data buffers (and therefore all 01-level record layouts defined in the file section) are initialized to all binary zeros when the program is loaded into storage. </li>

<li> Include the reserved word  <code>FINAL</code> if you want to include a special control heading before the first detail line is generated (<code>CONTROL HEADING FINAL</code>) or after the last detail line is generated (<code>CONTROL FOOTING FINAL</code>). </li>

<li> Any <var>identifier-9</var> specifications included on the <code>CONTROL</code> clause are referencing data names defined in any data division section except for the report section. </li>
<li> There must be a <code>CONTROL HEADING</code> and/or <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code> report group defined in the report section for each <var>identifier-9</var>. </li>
<li> At execution time: <ul> <li> Each time a <code>GENERATE</code> statement (see <a href="#GENERATE">GENERATE</a>) is executed against a detail report group defined for this <code>RD</code>, the RWCS will check the contents of each <var>identifier-2</var> data item; whenever an <var>identifier-9</var>’s value has changed since the previous <code>GENERATE</code>, a control break condition will be in effect for that <var>identifier-2</var>. </li>
<li> Once the list of control breaks has been determined, the <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code> for each <var>identifier-2</var> having a control break (if any such report group is defined) will be presented. </li>
<li> Next, the <code>CONTROL HEADING</code> for each <var>identifier-2</var> having a control break (if any such report group is defined) will be presented. </li>
<li> The <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code> and <code>CONTROL HEADING</code> report groups will be presented in the sequence in which they are listed on the <code>CONTROL</code> clause. </li>
<li> Only after this processing has occurred will the detail report group specified on the <code>GENERATE</code> be presented. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> Each <code>RD</code> will have the following allocated for it: <ol> <li> The   <code>PAGE-COUNTER</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>), which will contain the current report page number. <ul> <li> This register will be set to a value of 1 when an <code>INITIATE</code> statement (see <a href="#INITIATE">INITIATE</a>) is executed for the report and will be incremented by 1 each time the RWCS starts a new page of the report. </li>
<li> References to <code>PAGE-COUNTER</code> within the report section will be implicitly qualified with the name of the report to which the report group referencing the register belongs. </li>

These screen layouts may define the entire available screen area or any subset of it. </li>
<li> The term <i>available screen area</i> is a nebulous one in those environments where command-line shell sessions are invoked within a graphical user-interface environment, as will be the case on Windows, OSX and most Unix/Linux systems — these environments allow command-line session windows to exist with a variable number of available screen rows and columns.

<li> Data items with level numbers 01 (Constants), 66, 78 and 88 may be used in the screen section; they have the same syntax, rules and usage as they do in the other data division sections. </li>
<li> Without <code>LINE</code> (see <a href="#LINE">LINE</a>) or <code>COLUMN</code> (see <a href="#COLUMN">COLUMN</a>) clauses, screen section fields will display on the console window beginning at whatever line/column coordinate is stated or implied by the <code>ACCEPT screen-data-item</code> or <code>DISPLAY screen-data-item</code> statement that presents the screen item. After a field is presented to the console window, the next field will be presented immediately following that field. </li>
<li> A <code>LINE</code> clause explicitly stated in the definition of a screen section data item will override any <code>LINE</code> clause included on the <code>ACCEPT screen-data-item</code> or <code>DISPLAY screen-data-item</code> statement that presents that data item to the screen. The same is true of <code>COLUMN</code> clauses. </li>
<li> The <code class="key">Tab</code> and <code class="key">Back-Tab</code> (<code class="key">Shift</code>-<code class="key">Tab</code> on most keyboards) keys will position the cursor from field to field in the line/column sequence in which the fields occur on the screen at execution time, regardless of the sequence in which they were defined in the screen section. </li>

<li> Care must be taken that <var>constant-name-1</var> does not duplicate any other data item name that has been defined in the program as references to that data item name will refer to the constant and not the data item. The GnuCOBOL compiler will not issue a warning about this condition. </li>

</pre>  <p>This syntax is valid in the following sections: <code>FILE</code>, <code>WORKING-STORAGE</code>, <code>LOCAL-STORAGE</code>, <code>LINKAGE</code>, <code>REPORT</code>, <code>SCREEN</code> </p> <p>The picture clause defines the class (numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric), size and format of the data that may be contained by the data item being defined. Sometimes this role is assisted by the <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) clause, and in a few instances will be assumed entirely by that clause. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved word <code>IS</code> is optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The reserved word <code>PICTURE</code> may be abbreviated as <code>PIC</code>. Most programmers prefer to use the latter. </li>
<li> A picture clause may only be specified on an elementary item. </li>
<li> A <var>picture-string</var> is a sequence of the special symbols ‘<samp>$</samp>’, ‘<samp>*</samp>’, ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>,</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, ‘<samp>.</samp>’, ‘<samp>/</samp>’, ‘<samp>0</samp>’ (zero), ‘<samp>9</samp>’, ‘<samp>A</samp>’, ‘<samp>B</samp>’, <code>CR</code>, <code>DB</code>, ‘<samp>S</samp>’, ‘<samp>V</samp>’, ‘<samp>X</samp>’ and ‘<samp>Z</samp>’. </li>
<li> In general, each picture symbol represents either a single character in storage or a single decimal digit. There are a few exceptions, and they will be discussed as needed. </li>
<li> When a <var>picture-string</var> contains a repeated sequence of symbols — <code>PIC 9999/99/99</code> — for example, the repetition can be specified using a parenthetic repeat count, as in <code>PIC 9(4)/9(2)/9(2)</code>. Using repeat counts is optional and their use (or not) is entirely at the discretion of the programmer. Many programmers use repetition for small sequences (<code>PIC XXX</code>) and repeat counts for larger ones (<code>PIC 9(9)</code>. </li>
<li> This first set of picture symbols defines the basic data type of a data item. Each symbol represents a single character’s worth of storage. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>A</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Defines storage reserved for a single alphabetic character (‘<samp>A</samp>’-‘<samp>Z</samp>’, ‘<samp>a</samp>’-‘<samp>z</samp>’). </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>N</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Defines storage reserved for a single character in the computer’s  <em>National Character set</em>. Support for national character sets in GnuCOBOL is currently only partially implemented, and the compile- and run-time effect of using the ‘<samp>N</samp>’ picture symbol is the same as if <code>X(2)</code> had been coded, with the additional effect that such a field will qualify as a <code>NATIONAL</code> or <code>NATIONAL-EDITED</code> field on an <code>INITIALIZE</code> (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) statement. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>X</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Defines storage reserved for a single alphanumeric character (any character). </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>9</samp>’</dt> <dd><p>Defines storage reserved for a single numeric digit character (‘<samp>0</samp>’-‘<samp>9</samp>’). </p></dd> </dl> <p>Typically, only one kind of each of those symbols is used in the same picture clause, but that isn’t a requirement. Data items that, of the three symbols above, use nothing but ‘<samp>A</samp>’ picture symbols are known as  <em>Alphabetic Data Items</em> while those that use ‘<samp>9</samp>’ picture symbols without any ‘<samp>A</samp>’ or ‘<samp>X</samp>’ symbols (or those that have a <code>USAGE</code> without a <code>PICTURE</code>) are known as  <em>Numeric Data Items</em>. All other data items are referred to as  <em>Alphanumeric Data Items</em>. </p> <p>If you need to allocate space for a data item whose format is two letters followed by five digits followed by three letters, you could use the <var>picture-string</var> <code>AA99999AAA</code>, <code>A(2)9(5)A(3)</code> <code>XXXXXXXXXX</code> or <code>X(10)</code>. There is absolutely no functional difference whatsoever between the four — none of them provide any functionality the others do not. The first two probably make for better <i>documentation</i> of the expected field contents, but they don’t provide any run-time enforcement capabilities. </p> <p>As far as enforcement goes, however, both alphabetic and numeric picture strings do provide for both compile-time and run-time enforcement capabilities. In the case of compilation enforcement, the compiler can issue warning messages if you attempt to specify a non-numeric value for a numeric data item or if you attempt to <code>MOVE</code> (see <a href="#MOVE">MOVE</a>) a non-numeric data item to one that is numeric. Similar capabilities exist for alphabetic data items. At run-time, you may use a special class test (see <a href="#Class-Conditions">Class Conditions</a>) to determine if the contents of a data item are entirely numeric or entirely alphabetic. </p> </li>
<li> The following picture symbols may be used with numeric data items. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>P</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Defines an implied digit position that will be considered to be a zero when the data item is referenced at run-time. This symbol is used to allow data items that will contain very large values to be allocated using less storage by assuming a certain number of trailing zeros (one per ‘<samp>P</samp>’) to exist at the end of values. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>P</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>P</samp>’ symbol may only be used at the beginning or end of a picture clause. </p> <p>‘<samp>P</samp>’ is a repeatable symbol. </p> <p>All computations and <code>MOVE</code> (see <a href="#MOVE">MOVE</a>) operations involving such a data item will behave as if the zeros were actually there. </p> <p>For example, let’s say you need to allocate a data item that contains however many millions of dollars of revenue your company has in gross revenues this year: </p> <p><code>01 Gross-Revenue PIC 9(9).</code> </p> <p>In which case 9 characters of storage will be reserved. The values 000000000 through 999999999 will represent the gross-revenues. But, if only the millions are tracked (meaning the last six digits are always going to be 0), you could define the field as: </p> <p><code>01 Gross-Revenue PIC 9(3)P(6).</code> </p> <p>Whenever Gross-Revenue is referenced in calculations, or whenever its value is moved to another data item, the value of Gross-Revenue will be treated as if it is <code><var>nnn</var>000000</code>, where <code><var>nnn</var></code> is the actual value in storage. </p> <p>If you wanted to store the value 128 million into that field, you would do so as if the ‘<samp>P</samp>’s were ‘<samp>9</samp>’s: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">MOVE 128000000 TO Gross-Revenue
</pre>
</div> <p>A <code>DISPLAY</code> (see <a href="#DISPLAY">DISPLAY</a>) of a data item containing ‘<samp>P</samp>’ symbols is a little strange. The value displayed will be what is actually in storage, but the total size of the displayed value will be as if the ‘<samp>P</samp>’ symbols had been ‘<samp>9</samp>’s. Thus, after the above statement established a value for Gross-Revenue, a <code>DISPLAY Gross-Revenue</code> would produce output of ‘<samp>000000128</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>S</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>This symbol, if used, must be the very first symbol in the <code>PICTURE</code> value. A ‘<samp>S</samp>’ indicates that the data item is <code>Signed</code>, meaning that negative values are possible for this data item. Without an ‘<samp>S</samp>’, any negative values stored into this data item via a <code>MOVE</code> or arithmetic statement will have the negative sign stripped from it (in effect becoming the absolute value). </p> <p>The ‘<samp>S</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>S</samp>’ symbol may only occur once in a picture string. See <a href="#SIGN-IS">SIGN IS</a>, for further discussion of how negative values may be stored in a numeric data item. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>V</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>This symbol is used to define where an implied decimal-point (if any) is located in a numeric item. Just as there may only be a single decimal point in a number so may there be no more than one ‘<samp>V</samp>’ in a <code>PICTURE</code>. Implied decimal points occupy no space in storage — they just specify how values are used. For example, if the value <code>1234</code> is in storage in a field defined as <code>PIC 999V9</code>, that value would be treated as 123.4 in any statements that referenced it. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>V</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>V</samp>’ symbol may only occur once in a picture string. </p>
</dd> </dl> </li>
<li> Any editing symbols introduced past this point will, if coded in the picture clause of an otherwise numeric data item, transform that data item from a numeric to a  <em>Numeric Edited</em> data item. Numeric edited data items are treated as alphanumeric and may not serve either as table subscripts or as source arguments on an arithmetic statement. </li>
<li> The following are the fixed insertion editing symbols that may be specified in a picture string. Each of these editing symbols will insert a special character into the field value at the position it is specified in the picture string. These editing symbols will each introduce one extra character into the total field size for each occurrence of the symbol in the picture string. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>B</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>The ‘<samp>B</samp>’ editing symbol introduces a blank into the field value for each occurrence. </p> <p>Multiple ‘<samp>B</samp>’ symbols may be coded. </p> <p>The following example will format a ten digit number (presumably a telephone number) into a ‘<samp>### ### ####</samp>’ layout: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ...
        05 Phone-Number       PIC 9(3)B9(3)B9(4).
    ...
        MOVE 5185551212 TO Phone-Number
        DISPLAY Phone-Number
</pre> <p>This code will display ‘<samp>518 555 1212</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>0</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>The ‘<samp>0</samp>’ (zero) editing symbol introduces one “0” character into the field value for each occurrence in the picture string. </p> <p>Multiple ‘<samp>0</samp>’ symbols may be coded. </p> <p>Here’s an example: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ...
        05  Output-Item     PIC 909090909.
    ...
        MOVE 12345 TO Output-Item
        DISPLAY Output-Item
</pre> <p>The above will display ‘<samp>102030405</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>/</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>The ‘<samp>/</samp>’ editing symbol inserts one “/” character into the field value for each occurrence in the picture string. </p> <p>Multiple ‘<samp>/</samp>’ symbols may be coded. </p> <p>This editing symbol is most-frequently used to format dates, as follows: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ...
        05  Year-Month-Day   PIC 9(4)/9(2)/9(2).
    ...
        MOVE 20140207 TO Year-Month-Day
        DISPLAY Year-Month-Day
</pre> <p>This example displays ‘<samp>2014/02/07</samp>’. </p>
</dd> </dl> </li>
<li> The following are the numeric formatting symbols that may be specified in a picture string. Each of these editing symbols will insert special characters into the field value to present numbers in a “friendly” format. These editing symbols will each introduce one extra character into the total field size for each occurrence of the symbol in the picture string. Numeric fields whose picture clause contains these characters may neither be used as source fields in any calculation nor may they serve as source fields for the transfer of data values to any data item other than an alphanumeric field. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>.</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>The ‘<samp>.</samp>’ symbol inserts a decimal point into a numeric field value. When the contents of a numeric data item sending field are moved into a receiving data item whose picture clause contains the ‘<samp>.</samp>’ editing symbol, implied (‘<samp>V</samp>’) or actual decimal point in the sending data item or literal, respectively, will be aligned with the ‘<samp>.</samp>’ symbol in the receiving field. Digits are then transferred from the sending to the receiving field outward from the sending field’s ‘<samp>V</samp>’ or ‘<samp>.</samp>’, truncating sending digits if there aren’t enough positions in the receiving field. Any digit positions in the receiving field that don’t receive digits from the sending field, if any, will be set to 0. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>.</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>An example will probably help: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ...
    05  Source-Field   PIC 9(2)V9 VALUE 7.2.
    05  Dest-Field     PIC 9(5).9(2).
    ...
    MOVE 1234567.89 TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
    MOVE 19 TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
    MOVE Source-Field TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
</pre> <p>The example will display three results — ‘<samp>34567.89</samp>’, ‘<samp>00019.00</samp>’ and ‘<samp>00007.20</samp>’. </p> <p>Both data item definitions <i>appear</i> to have <i>two</i> decimal points in their picture clauses. They actually don’t, because the last character of every data item definition is always a period — the period that ends the definition. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>,</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>The ‘<samp>,</samp>’ symbol serves as a thousands separator. Many times, you’ll see large numbers formatted with these symbols — for example, 123,456,789. This can be accomplished easily by adding thousands separator symbols to a picture string. Thousands separator symbols that aren’t needed will behave as if they were ‘<samp>9</samp>’s. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>,</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>Here’s an example: </p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ...
    05  My-Lottery-Winnings   PIC 9(3),9(3),9(3).
    ...
    MOVE 12345 TO My-Lottery-Winnings
    DISPLAY My-Lottery-Winnings
</pre> <p>The value ‘<samp>0000012,345</samp>’ (a very disappointing one for my retirement plans, but a good thousands separator demo) will be displayed. Notice how, since the first comma wasn’t needed due to the meagre amount I won, it behaved like another ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>If desired, you may reverse the roles of the ‘<samp>.</samp>’ and ‘<samp>,</samp>’ editing symbols by specifying <code>DECIMAL POINT IS COMMA</code> in the <code>SPECIAL-NAMES</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) paragraph. </p> </li>
<li> The following are insertion symbols. They are used to insert an extra character (two in the case of <code>CR</code> and <code>DB</code>) to signify the sign (positive or negative) of the numeric value that is moved into the field whose picture string contains one of these symbols, or the fact that the data item represents a currency (money) amount. Only one of the ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, <code>CR</code> or <code>DB</code> symbols may be used in a picture clause. In this context, when any of these symbols are used in a <var>picture-string</var>, they must be at the end. The ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’ and/or currency symbols may also be used as floating editing symbols at the <i>beginning</i> of the <var>picture-string</var> — a subject that will be covered in the next numbered paragraph. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>+</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), a ‘<samp>+</samp>’ character will be inserted. If the value is negative (less than 0), a ‘<samp>-</samp>’ character is inserted. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>+</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>-</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), a space will be inserted. If the value is negative (less than 0), a ‘<samp>-</samp>’ character is inserted. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>-</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt><code>CR</code></dt> <dd>
<p>This symbol is coded as the two characters ‘<samp>C</samp>’ and ‘<samp>R</samp>’. If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), two spaces will be inserted. If the value is negative (less than 0), the characters <code>CR</code> (credit) are inserted. </p> <p>The <code>CR</code> symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt><code>DB</code></dt> <dd>
<p>This symbol is coded as the two characters ‘<samp>D</samp>’ and ‘<samp>B</samp>’. If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), two spaces will be inserted. If the value is negative (less than 0), the characters <code>DB</code> (debit) are inserted. </p> <p>The <code>DB</code> symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>$</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Regardless of the value moved into the field, this symbol will insert the currency symbol into the data item’s value in the position where it occurs in the <var>picture-string</var> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>). </p> <p>The ‘<samp>$</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p>
</dd> </dl> </li>
<li> These editing symbols are known as floating replacement symbols. These symbols may occur in sequences <i>before</i> any ‘<samp>9</samp>’ editing symbols in the <var>picture-string</var> of a numeric data item. Using these symbols transforms that numeric data item into a numerid <i>edited</i> data item, which can no longer be used in calculations or subscripts. </li>
<li> Each of the following symbols behave like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’, until such point as all digits in the numeric value are exhausted and leading zeros are about to be inserted. In effect, these editing symbols define what should happen to those leading zero. <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>$</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Of those currency symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its ‘<samp>0</samp>’ value replaced by the currency symbol in-effect for the program (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>). Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>$</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>Any currency symbol coded to the right of a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ will be treated exactly like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>*</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>This symbol is referred to as a check protection symbol. All check-protection symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside will have their ‘<samp>0</samp>’ values replaced by ‘<samp>*</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>*</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>Any check-suppression symbol coded to the right of a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ will be treated exactly like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>+</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Of those ‘<samp>+</samp>’ symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its ‘<samp>0</samp>’ value replaced by a ‘<samp>+</samp>’ if the value in the data item is zero or greater or a ‘<samp>-</samp>’ otherwise. Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces. You cannot use both ‘<samp>+</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-</samp>’ in the same <var>picture-string</var>. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>+</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>Any ‘<samp>+</samp>’ symbol coded to the right of a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ will be treated exactly like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>-</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Of those ‘<samp>-</samp>’ symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its ‘<samp>0</samp>’ value replaced by a space if the value in the data item is zero or greater or a ‘<samp>-</samp>’ otherwise. Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces. You cannot use both ‘<samp>+</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-</samp>’ in the same <var>picture-string</var>. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>-</samp>’ symbol is not allowed in conjunction with ‘<samp>N</samp>’. </p> <p>Any ‘<samp>-</samp>’ symbol coded to the right of a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ will be treated exactly like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp>Z</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>All ‘<samp>Z</samp>’ symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside will have their ‘<samp>0</samp>’ values replaced by spaces. </p> <p>Any zero-suppression symbol coded to the right of a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ will be treated exactly like a ‘<samp>9</samp>’. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>‘<samp>Z</samp>’ and ‘<samp>*</samp>’ should not be coded in the same <var>picture-string</var> </p> <p>‘<samp>+</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-</samp>’ should not be coded in the same <var>picture-string</var> </p> <p>When multiple floating symbols are coded, even if there is only one of them used they will all be considered floating and will all be able to assume each other’s properties. For example, if a data item has a <code>PIC +$ZZZZ9.99</code> <var>picture-string</var>, and a value of 1 is moved to that field at run-time, the resulting value will be (the <i>b</i> symbol represents a space) <code><i>bbbb</i>+$1.00</code>. This is not consistent with many other COBOL implementations, where the result would have been <code>+$<i>bbbb</i>1.00</code>. </p> <p>Most other COBOL implementations reject the use of multiple occurrences of multiple floating editing symbols. For example, they would reject <var>picture-string</var>s such as <code>+++$$$9.99</code>, <code>$$$ZZZ9.99</code> and so on. GnuCOBOL accepts these. Programmers creating GnuCOBOL programs should avoid such <var>picture-string</var>s if there is any likelihood that those programs may be used with other COBOL implementations. </p>

<li> Binary data (integer or floating-point) can be stored in either a <i>Big-Endian</i> or <i>Little-Endian</i> form. <p>Big-endian data allocation calls for the bytes that comprise a binary item to be allocated such that the least-significant byte is the right-most byte. For example, a four-byte binary item having a value of decimal 20 would be big-endian allocated as 00000014 (shown in hexadecimal notation). </p> <p>Little-endian data allocation calls for the bytes that comprise a binary item to be allocated such that the least-significant byte is the left-most byte. For example, a four-byte binary item having a value of decimal 20 would be little-endian allocated as 14000000 (shown in hexadecimal notation). </p> <p>All CPUs are capable of <i>understanding</i> big-endian format, which makes it the <i>most compatible</i> form of binary storage across computer systems. </p> <p>Some CPUs — such as the Intel/AMD i386/x64 architecture processors used in most Windows PCs — prefer to process binary data stored in a little-endian format. Since that format is more efficient on those systems, it is referred to as the <i>native</i> binary format. </p> <p>On a system supporting only one format of binary storage (generally, that would be big-endian), the terms <i>most efficient</i> and <i>native</i> format are synonymous. </p> </li>
<li> Data items that have the  <code>UNSIGNED</code> attribute explicitly coded, or <code>DISPLAY</code>, <code>PACKED-DECIMAL</code>, <code>COMP-5</code>, <code>COMP-X</code> items that do not have an ‘<samp>S</samp>’ symbol in their picture clause cannot preserve negative values that may be stored into them. Storing a negative value into such a field will actually result in the sign being stripped, essentially saving the absolute value in the data item. </li>
<li> Packed-decimal (<i>i.e.</i> <code>USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL</code>, <code>USAGE COMP-3</code> or <code>USAGE COMP-6</code>) data is stored as a series of bytes such that each byte contains two 4-bit fields, referred to as <em>nibbles</em> (since they comprise half a “byte”, they’re just “nibbles” — don’t groan, I don’t just make this stuff up!). Each nibble represents a ‘<samp>9</samp>’ in the <code>PICTURE</code> and each holds a single decimal digit encoded as its binary value (0 = 0000, 1 = 0001, … , 9 = 1001). <p>The <i>last</i> byte of a <code>PACKED-DECIMAL</code> or <code>COMP-3</code> data item will always have its left nibble corresponding to the last ‘<samp>9</samp>’ in the <code>PICTURE</code> and its right nibble reserved as a sign indicator. This sign indicator is always present regardless of whether or not the <code>PICTURE</code> included an ‘<samp>S</samp>’ symbol. </p> <p>The <i>first</i> byte of the data item will contain an unused left nibble if the <code>PICTURE</code> had an even number of ‘<samp>9</samp>’ symbols in it. </p> <p>The sign indicator will have a value of a hexadecimal A through F. Traditional packed decimal encoding rules call for hexadecimal values of F, A, C or E (“FACE”) in the sign nibble to indicate a positive value and B or D to represent a negative value (hexadecimal digits 0-9 are undefined). Testing with a Windows MinGW/GnuCOBOL implementation shows that — in fact — hex digit D represents a negative number and any other hexadecimal digit denotes a positive number. Therefore, a <code>PIC S9(3) COMP-3</code> packed-decimal field with a value of -15 would be stored internally as a hexadecimal 015D in GnuCOBOL. </p> <p>If you attempt to store a negative number into a packed decimal field that has no ‘<samp>S</samp>’ in its <code>PICTURE</code>, the absolute value of the negative number will actually be stored. </p> <p><code>USAGE COMP-6</code> does not allow for negative values, therefore no sign nibble will be allocated. A <code>USAGE COMP-6</code> data item containing an odd number of ‘<samp>9</samp>’ symbols in its <code>PICTURE</code> will leave its leftmost nibble unused. </p> </li>
<li> The <code>USAGE</code> specifications <code>FLOAT-DECIMAL-16</code> and <code>FLOAT-DECIMAL-34</code> will encode data using IEEE 754 <i>Decimal64</i> and <i>Decimal128</i> format, respectively. The former allows for up to 16 digits of exact precision while the latter offers 34. The phrase “exact precision” is used because the traditional binary renderings of decimal real numbers in a floating-point format (<code>FLOAT-LONG</code> and <code>FLOAT-SHORT</code>, for example) only yield an approximation of the actual value because many decimal fractions cannot be precisely rendered in binary. The Decimal64 and Decimal128 renderings, however, render decimal real numbers in encoded decimal form in much the same way that <code>PACKED-DECIMAL</code> renders a decimal integer in digit-by-digit decimal form. The exact manner in which this rendering is performed is complex (Wikipedia has an excellent article on the subject — just search for <i>Decimal64</i>). </li>
<li> GnuCOBOL stores <code>FLOAT-DECIMAL-16</code> and <code>FLOAT-DECIMAL-34</code> data items using either Big-Endian or Little-Endian form, whichever is native to the system. </li>
<li> The <code>USAGE</code> specifications <code>FLOAT-LONG</code> and <code>FLOAT-SHORT</code> use the IEEE 754 <i>Binary64</i> and <i>Binary32</i> formats, respectively. These are binary encodings of real decimal numbers, and as such cannot represent every possible value between the minimum and maximum values in the range for those usages. Wikipedia has an excellent article on the Binary64 and Binary32 encoding schemes — just search on <i>Binary32</i> or <i>Binary64</i>. <p>GnuCOBOL stores <code>FLOAT-LONG</code> and <code>FLOAT-SHORT</code> data items using either Big-Endian or Little-Endian form, whichever is native to the system. </p> </li>
<li> A <code>USAGE</code> clause specified at the group item level will apply that <code>USAGE</code> to all subordinate data items, except those that themselves have a <code>USAGE</code> clause. </li>
<li> The only <code>USAGE</code> that is allowed in the report section is <code>USAGE DISPLAY</code>. </li>

<li> See <a href="#Condition-Names">Condition Names</a>, for a discussion of how condition names are used. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points apply to using the <code>VALUE</code> clause in the definition of any other data item: <ol> <li> In this context, <code>VALUE</code> specifies an initial compilation-time value that will be assigned to the storage occupied by the data item in the program object code generated by the compiler. </li>

<li> If there is no picture clause and the <code>ALL</code> option is specified, the <code>ALL</code> option will be ignored. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> Giving a table an initial, compile-time value is one of the trickier aspects of COBOL data definition. There are basically three standard techniques and a fourth that people familiar with other COBOL implementations but new to GnuCOBOL may find interesting. So, here are the three <i>standard</i> approaches: <ol> <li> Don’t bother worrying about it at compile-time. Use the <code>INITIALIZE</code> (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) to initialize all data item occurrences in a table (at run-time) to their data-type-specific default values (numerics: 0, alphabetic and alphanumerics: spaces). </li>
<li> Initialize small tables at compile time by including a <code>VALUE</code> clause on the group item that serves as a parent to the table, as follows: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">05  SHIRT-SIZES          VALUE "S 14M 15L 16XL17".
    10 SHIRT-SIZE-TBL    OCCURS 4 TIMES.
       15 SST-SIZE       PIC X(2).
       15 SST-NECK       PIC 9(2).
</pre>
</div> </li>
<li> Initialize tables of almost any size at compilation time by utilizing the <code>REDEFINES</code> (see <a href="#REDEFINES">REDEFINES</a>) clause: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">05  SHIRT-SIZE-VALUES.
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "S 14".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "M 15".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "L 16".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE <code>XL17</code>.
05  SHIRT-SIZES          REDEFINES SHIRT-SIZE-VALUES.
    10 SHIRT-SIZE-TBL    OCCURS 4 TIMES.
       15 SST-SIZE       PIC X(2).
       15 SST-NECK       PIC 9(2).
</pre>
</div> <p>Admittedly, this table is much more verbose than the one shown with a group <code>VALUE</code>. What is good about this initialization technique, however, is that you can have as many <code>FILLER</code> and <code>VALUE</code> items as you need for a larger table, and those values can be as long as necessary! </p>
</li>
</ol> </li>
<li> Many COBOL compilers do not allow the use of <code>VALUE</code> and <code>OCCURS</code> (see <a href="#OCCURS">OCCURS</a>) on the same data item; additionally, they don’t allow a <code>VALUE</code> clause on a data item subordinate to an <code>OCCURS</code>. GnuCOBOL, however, has neither of these restrictions! <p>Observe the following example, which illustrates a fourth manner in which tables may be initialized in GnuCOBOL: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">05  X           OCCURS 6 TIMES.
    10 A        PIC X(1) VALUE '?'.
    10 B        PIC X(1) VALUE '%'.
    10 N        PIC 9(2) VALUE 10.
</pre>
</div> <p>In this example, all six ‘<samp>A</samp>’ items will be initialized to ‘<samp>?</samp>’, all six ‘<samp>B</samp>’ items will be initialized to ‘<samp>%</samp>’ and all six ‘<samp>N</samp>’ items will be initialized to 10. It’s not clear exactly how many times this sort of initialization will be useful, but it’s there if you need it. </p>
</li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The <code>FROM</code> (see <a href="#FROM">FROM</a>), <code>TO</code> (see <a href="#TO">TO</a>), <code>USING</code> (see <a href="#USING">USING</a>) and <code>VALUE</code> clauses are mutually-exclusive in any screen section data item’s definition. </li>

<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>BY</code> and <code>IS</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words have no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The  <code>USING</code> clause should only be used on the procedure division header of subprograms (subroutines or user-defined functions). </li>
<li> The calling program will pass zero or more data items, known as arguments, to this subprogram — there must be exactly as many <var>identifier-1</var> data items specified on the <code>USING</code> clause as the maximum number of arguments the subprogram will ever be passed. </li>
<li> If a subprogram does not expect any arguments, it should not have a <code>USING</code> clause specified on its procedure division header. </li>
<li> The order in which arguments are defined on the <code>USING</code> clause must correspond to the order in which those arguments will be passed to the subprogram by the calling program. </li>
<li> The identifiers specified on the <code>USING</code> clause must be defined in the linkage section of the subprogram. No storage is actually allocated for those identifiers in the subprogram as the actual storage for them will exist in the calling program. </li>
<li> A GnuCOBOL subprogram expects that all arguments to it will be one of two things: <ul> <li> The memory address of the actual data item (allocated in the calling program) that is being passed to the subprogram. </li>
<li> A numeric, full-word, binary value (i.e. <code>USAGE BINARY-LONG</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>)) which is the actual argument being passed to the subprogram. </li>
</ul> <p>In the case of the former, the <code>USING</code> clause on the procedure division header should describe the argument via the  <code>BY REFERENCE</code> clause — in the latter case, a  <code>BY VALUE</code> specification should be coded. This allows the code generated by the compiler to properly reference the subprogram arguments at run-time. </p> </li>
<li> <code>BY REFERENCE</code> is the assumed default for the first <code>USING</code> argument should no <code>BY</code> clause be specified for it. Subsequent arguments will assume the <code>BY</code> specification of the argument prior to them should they lack a <code>BY</code> clause of their own. </li>
<li> Changes made by a subprogram to the value of an argument specified on the <code>USING</code> clause will “be visible” to the calling program only if <code>BY REFERENCE</code> was explicitly specified or implicitly assumed for the argument on the subprogram’s procedure division header <i>and</i> the argument was passed to the subprogram <code>BY REFERENCE</code> by the calling program. See <a href="#Subprogram-Arguments">Subprogram Arguments</a>, for additional information on the mechanics of how arguments are passed to subprograms. </li>
<li> The optional <code>SIZE</code> clause allows you to specify the number of bytes a <code>BY VALUE</code> argument will occupy, with <code>SIZE DEFAULT</code> specifying 4 bytes (this is the default if no <code>SIZE</code> clause is used), <code>SIZE AUTO</code> specifying the size of the argument in the calling program and <code>SIZE <var>integer-1</var></code> specifying a specific byte count. </li>
<li> The optional <code>UNSIGNED</code> keyword, legal only if <code>SIZE AUTO</code> or <code>SIZE <var>integer-1</var></code> are coded, will add the <code>unsigned</code> attribute to the argument’s specification in the C-language function header code generated for the subprogram. While not of any benefit when the calling program is a GnuCOBOL program, this can improve compatibility with a C-language calling program. </li>
<li> The  <code>OPTIONAL</code> keyword, legal only on <code>BY REFERENCE</code> arguments, allows calling programs to code  <code>OMITTED</code> for that corresponding argument when they call this subprogram. See <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>. for additional information on this feature. </li>

      ~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~
</pre>  <p>The <code>CHAINING</code> term provides one mechanism a programmer may use to retrieve command-line arguments passed to a program at execution time. </p>
<ol> <li> <code>PROCEDURE DIVISION CHAINING</code> may only be coded in a main program (that is, the first program executed when a compiled GnuCOBOL compilation unit is executed). It cannot be used in any form of subprogram. </li>
<li> The <code>CHAINING</code> clause defines arguments that will be passed to a main program from the operating system. The argument identifiers specified on the <code>CHAINING</code> clause will be populated by character strings comprised of the parameters specified to the program on the command line that executed it, as follows: <ol> <li> When a GnuCOBOL program is executed from a command-line, the complete command line text will be broken into a series of <i>tokens</i>, where each token is identified as being a word separated from the others in the command text by at least one space. For example, if the command line was <code>/usr/local/myprog THIS IS A TEST</code>, there will be five tokens identified by the operating system — ‘<samp>/usr/local/myprog</samp>’, ‘<samp>THIS</samp>’, ‘<samp>IS</samp>’, ‘<samp>A</samp>’ and ‘<samp>TEST</samp>’. </li>
<li> Multiple space-delimited tokens may be treated as a single token by enclosing them in quotes. For example, there are only three tokens generated from the command line <code>C:\Pgms\myprog.exe ‘<samp>THIS IS A</samp>’ TEST</code> — ‘<samp>C:\Pgms\myprog.exe</samp>’, ‘<samp>THIS IS A</samp>’ and ‘<samp>TEST</samp>’. When quote characters are used to create multi-word tokens, the quote characters themselves are stripped from the token’s value. </li>
<li> Once tokens have been identified, the first one (the command) will be discarded; the rest will be stored into the <code>CHAINING</code> arguments when the program begins execution, with the 2nd token going to the 1<sup>st</sup> argument, the 3rd token going to the 2nd argument and so forth. </li>
<li> If there are more tokens than there are arguments, the excess tokens will be discarded. </li>
<li> If there are fewer tokens than there are arguments, the excess arguments will be initialized as if the <code>INITIALIZE <var>identifier-1</var></code> (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) statement were executed. </li>
<li> All identifiers specified on the <code>CHAINING</code> clause should be defined as <code>PIC X, PIC A</code>, group items (which are treated implicitly as <code>PIC X</code>) or as <code>PIC 9 USAGE DISPLAY</code>. The use of <code>USAGE BINARY</code> (or the like) data items as <code>CHAINING</code> arguments is not recommended as all command-line tokens will be retained in their original character form as they are moved into the argument data items. </li>
<li> If an argument identifier is smaller in storage size than the token value to be stored in it, the right-most excess characters of the token value will be truncated as the value is moved in. Any <code>JUSTIFIED RIGHT</code> clause on such an argument identifier will be ignored. </li>
<li> If an argument is larger in storage size than the token value to be stored in it, the token value will be moved into the argument identifier in a left-justified manner. unmodified-modified byte positions in the identifier will be space filled, unless the argument identifier is defined as <code>PIC 9 USAGE DISPLAY</code>, in which case unmodified bytes will be filled with ‘<samp>0</samp>’ characters from the systems native character set. <p>This behaviour when the argument is defined as <code>PIC 9</code> may be unacceptable, as an argument defined as <code>PIC 9(3)</code> but passed in a value of ‘<samp>1</samp>’ from the command line will receive a value of ‘<samp>100</samp>’, not ‘<samp>001</samp>’. Consider defining “numeric” command line arguments as <code>PIC X</code> and then using the <code>NUMVAL</code> intrinsic function (see <a href="#NUMVAL">NUMVAL</a>) function to determine the proper numeric value. </p>

 ~~~~~~~~~
</pre>  <p>The RETURNING clause on the PROCEDURE DIVISION header documents that the subprogram in which the clause appears will be returning a numeric value back to the program that called it. </p>
<ol> <li> The <code>RETURNING</code> clause is optional within a subroutine, as not all subroutines return a value to their caller. </li>
<li> The <code>RETURNING</code> clause is mandatory within a user-defined function, as all such must return a numeric result. </li>
<li> The <var>identifier-1</var> data item should be defined as a <code>USAGE BINARY-LONG</code> data item. </li>
<li> Main programs that wish to “pass back” a return code value to the operating system when they exit do not use <code>RETURNING</code> - they do so simply by MOVEing a value to the <code>RETURN-CODE</code> special register. </li>
<li> This is not the only mechanism that a subprogram may use to pass a value back to its caller. Other possibilities are: <ol> <li> The subprogram may modify any argument that is specified as <code>BY REFERENCE</code> on its <code>PROCEDURE DIVISION</code> header. Whether the calling program can actually “see” any modifications depends upon how the calling program passed the argument to the subprogram. See <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>, for more information. </li>
<li> A data item with the <code>GLOBAL</code> (see <a href="#GLOBAL">GLOBAL</a>) attribute specified in its description in the calling program is automatically visible to and updatable by a subprogram nested with the calling program. See <a href="#Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">Independent vs Contained vs Nested Subprograms</a>, for more information on subprogram nesting. </li>
<li> A data item defined with the <code>EXTERNAL</code> (see <a href="#EXTERNAL">EXTERNAL</a>) attribute in a subprogram and the calling program (same name in both programs) is automatically visible to and updatable by both programs, even if those programs are compiled separately from one another. </li>

</pre> <p>The  <code>AFTER EXCEPTION CONDITION</code> and <code>AFTER EC</code> clauses are syntactically recognized but are otherwise non-functional. </p> <p>The <code>DECLARATIVES</code> area of the procedure division allows the programmer to define a series of “trap” procedures (referred to as declarative procedures) capable of intercepting certain events that may occur at program execution time.

<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>AFTER</code>, <code>FOR</code>, <code>ON</code>, <code>PROCEDURE</code> and <code>STANDARD</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> <code>EC</code> and <code>EXCEPTION CONDITION</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> The declaratives area may contain any number of declarative procedures, but no two declarative procedures should be coded to trap the same event. </li>
<li> The following points apply to the  <code>USE BEFORE REPORTING</code> clause: <ol> <li> <var>identifier-2</var> must be a report group. </li>
<li> At run-time, the declaratives procedure will be executed prior to the processing of the specified report group’s presentation; within the procedure you may take either of the following actions: <ul> <li> You may adjust the value(s) of any items referenced in <code>SUM</code> (see <a href="#SUM">SUM</a>) or <code>SOURCE</code> (see <a href="#SOURCE">SOURCE</a>) clauses in the report group. </li>
<li> You may execute the <code>SUPPRESS</code> (see <a href="#SUPPRESS">SUPPRESS</a>) statement to squelch the presentation of the specified report group altogether. Note that you will be suppressing this one specific instance of that group’s presentation and not all of them. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points apply to the  <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> clause: <ol> <li> This clause allows you to define a declarative procedure that will be invoked whenever… <ul> <li> …<var>identifier-1</var> is referenced on any statement. </li>
<li> …<var>procedure-name-1</var> is executed. </li>
<li> …any procedure is executed (<code>ALL PROCEDURES</code>). </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> A <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> declarative procedure will be ignored at <i>compilation</i> time unless <code>WITH DEBUGGING MODE</code> is specified in the <code>SOURCE-COMPUTER</code> (see <a href="#SOURCE_002dCOMPUTER">SOURCE-COMPUTER</a>) paragraph.

<li> Any <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> declarative procedures will be ignored at <i>execution</i> time unless the   <code>COB_SET_DEBUG</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) has been set to a value of ‘<samp>Y</samp>’, ‘<samp>y</samp>’ or ‘<samp>1</samp>’. </li>
<li> The typical use of a <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> declarative procedure is to display the   <code>DEBUG-ITEM</code> special register, which will be implicitly and automatically created in your program for you if <code>WITH DEBUGGING MODE</code> is active. <p>The structure of <code>DEBUG-ITEM</code> will be as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  DEBUG-ITEM.

Special Registers</h2> <p>GnuCOBOL, like other COBOL dialects, includes a number of data items that are automatically available to a programmer without the need to actually define them in the data division. COBOL refers to such items as registers or special registers. The special registers available to a GnuCOBOL program are as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>COB-CRT-STATUS</code></dt> <dd>
<p>PIC 9(4) — This is the default data item allocated for use by the <code>ACCEPT <var>screen-data-item</var></code> statement (see <a href="#ACCEPT-screen_002ddata_002ditem">ACCEPT screen-data-item</a>), if no <code>CRT STATUS</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) clause was specified.. </p> </dd> <dt><code>DEBUG-ITEM</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Group Item — A group item in which debugging information generated by a <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> section in the declaratives area of the procedure division will place information documenting why the <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> procedure was invoked. Consult the <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) documentation for information on the structure of this register. </p> </dd> <dt><code>LINAGE-COUNTER</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — An occurrence of this register exists for each selected file having a <code>LINAGE</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>) clause. If there are multiple files whose file descriptions have <code>LINAGE</code> clauses, any explicit references to this register will require qualification (using <code>OF file-name</code>). The value of this register will be the current logical line number within the page body. The value of this register cannot be modified. </p> </dd> <dt><code>LINE-COUNTER</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — An occurrence of this register exists for each report defined in the program (via an <code>RD</code> (see <a href="#REPORT-SECTION">REPORT SECTION</a>)). If there are multiple reports, any explicit references to this register not made in the report section will require qualification (<code>OF report-name</code>). The value of this register will be the current logical line number on the current page. The value of this register cannot be modified. </p> </dd> <dt><code>NUMBER-OF-CALL-PARAMETERS</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — This register contains the number of arguments passed to a subroutine — the same value that would be returned by the <code>C$NARG</code> built-in system subroutine (see <a href="#C_0024NARG">C$NARG</a>). Its value will be zero when referenced in a main program. This register, when referenced from within a user-defined function, returns a value of one (‘<samp>1</samp>’) if the function has any number of arguments and a zero if it has no arguments. </p> </dd> <dt><code>PAGE-COUNTER</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — An occurrence of this register exists for each report having an <code>RD</code> (see <a href="#REPORT-SECTION">REPORT SECTION</a>). If there are multiple such reports, any explicit references to this register not made in the report section will require qualification ( <code>OF report-name</code>). The value of this register will be the current report page number. The value of this register cannot be modified. </p> </dd> <dt><code>RETURN-CODE</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — This register provides a numeric data item into which a subroutine may <code>MOVE</code> (see <a href="#MOVE">MOVE</a>) a value (which will then be available to the calling program) prior to transferring control back to the program that called it, or into which a main program may <code>MOVE</code> a value before returning control to the operating system. Many built-in subroutines will return a value using this register. These values are — by convention — used to signify success (usually with a value of 0) or failure (usually with a non-zero value) of the process the program was attempting to perform. This register may also be modified by a subprogram as a result of that subprogram’s use of the <code>RETURNING</code> (see <a href="#PROCEDURE-DIVISION-RETURNING">PROCEDURE DIVISION RETURNING</a>) clause. </p> </dd> <dt><code>SORT-RETURN</code></dt> <dd>
<p><code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code> — This register is used to report the success/fail status of a <code>RELEASE</code> (see <a href="#RELEASE">RELEASE</a>) or <code>RETURN</code> (see <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>) statement. A value of 0 is reported on success. A value of 16 denotes failure. An <code>AT END</code> (see <a href="#AT-END-_002b-NOT-AT-END">AT END + NOT AT END</a>) condition on a <code>RETURN</code> is not considered a failure. </p> </dd> <dt><code>WHEN-COMPILED</code></dt> <dd><p><code>PIC X(16)</code> — This register contains the date and time the program was compiled in the format ‘<samp>mm/dd/yyhh.mm.ss</samp>’. Note that only a two-digit year is provided. </p></dd> </dl> <h4>LENGTH OF Syntax </h4> <pre class="verbatim"> LENGTH OF numeric-literal-1 | identifier-1
 ~~~~~~</pre>  <p>Alphanumeric literals and identifiers may optionally be prefixed with the <code>LENGTH OF</code> clause. The compile-time value generated by this clause will be the number of bytes in the alphanumeric literal or the defined size (in bytes) of the identifier. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved word <code>OF</code> is optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program. Here is an example.

<li> When you accept from the  <code>COMMAND-LINE</code> option, you will retrieve the entire set of arguments entered on the command line that executed the program, exactly as they were specified. Parsing that returned data into its meaningful information will be your responsibility. </li>
<li> Using <code>COMMAND-LINE</code> or <code>ARGUMENT-VALUE</code> in a *nix based platform and that includes Linux, OSX, BSD and under windows running msys or MinGW etc, the shell process will expand any arguments that have a ‘<samp>*</samp>’ in the list — such as ‘<samp>a*</samp>’, ‘<samp>abc*.*</samp>’, etc. — and create a list of all files that match the pattern. To avoid this if not wanted, put all such argument within quotes, <i>e.g.</i>, <code>progundertest "a*" b c d "ef*" "*hg"</code> and the text within quotes will be passed verbatim to the program (as in the example <code>progundertest</code>). </li>
<li> By accepting from  <code>ARGUMENT-NUMBER</code>, you will be asking the GnuCOBOL run-time system to parse the arguments from the command line and return the number of arguments found. Parsing will be conducted according to the following rules: <ol> <li> Arguments will be separated by treating spaces and/or tab characters as the delimiters between arguments. The number of such delimiters separating two non-blank argument values is irrelevant. </li>
<li> Strings enclosed in double-quote characters (‘<samp>"</samp>’) will be treated as a single argument, regardless of how many spaces or tab characters (if any) might be embedded within the quotation characters. </li>
<li> On Windows systems, single-quote, or apostrophe, characters (‘<samp>'</samp>’) will be treated just like any other data character and will <i>not</i> delineate argument strings. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> By accepting from  <code>ARGUMENT-VALUE</code>, you will be asking the GnuCOBOL run-time system to parse the arguments from the command line and return the “current” argument. You specify which argument number is “current” via the <code>ARGUMENT-NUMBER</code> option on the <code>DISPLAY</code> statement (see <a href="#DISPLAY-UPON-COMMAND_002dLINE">DISPLAY UPON COMMAND-LINE</a>). Parsing of arguments will be conducted according to the rules set forth above. </li>

<ol> <li> The reserved word <code>ON</code> is optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> By accepting from  <code>ENVIRONMENT-VALUE</code>, you will be asking the GnuCOBOL run-time system to retrieve the value of the environment variable whose name is currently in the  <code>ENVIRONMENT-NAME</code> register.

<li> A simpler approach to retrieving an environment variables value is to use the  <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> option, where you specify the environment variable whose value is to be retrieved right on the <code>ACCEPT</code> statement itself. </li>
<li> The optional <code>ON EXCEPTION</code> and <code>NOT ON EXCEPTION</code> clauses may be used to detect and react to an attempt to retrieve the value of a non-existent environment variable or the successful retrieval of an environment variable’s value, respectively.

<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>AFTER</code>, <code>IS</code>, <code>NUMBER</code> and <code>ON</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>

<li> If <var>identifier-1</var> is defined in the <code>SCREEN SECTION</code> (see <a href="#SCREEN-SECTION">SCREEN SECTION</a>), any <code>AT</code>, <var>Attribute-Specification</var>, <code>LOWER</code>, <code>UPPER</code> or <code>SCROLL</code> clauses will be ignored. In these cases, an implied <code>DISPLAY</code> (see <a href="#DISPLAY-screen_002ddata_002ditem">DISPLAY screen-data-item</a>) of <var>identifier-1</var> will occur before input is accepted. Coding an explicit <code>DISPLAY identifier-1</code> before an <code>ACCEPT identifier-1</code> is redundant and will incur the performance penalty of painting the screen contents twice. </li>
<li> The various <code>AT</code> clauses provide a means of positioning the cursor to a specific spot on the screen before the screen is read. One or the other (but not both) may be used, as follows: <ol> <li> The <code>LINE</code> and <code>COLUMN</code> clauses provide one mechanism for specifying the line and column position to which the cursor will be positioned before allowing the user to enter data. In the absence of one or the other, a value of 1 will be assumed for the one that is missing. The author’s personal preference, however, is to explicitly code both. </li>
<li> The <var>literal-3</var> or <var>identifier-4</var> value, if specified, must be a four- or six-digit value with the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the number indicating the line where the cursor should be positioned and the second half indicating the column. You may code only one of each clause on any <code>ACCEPT</code>. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> <code>WITH</code> options (including the various individual <var>Attribute-Specifications</var>) should be coded only once. </li>
<li> The following <var>Attribute-Specification</var> clauses are allowed on the <code>ACCEPT</code> statement; these are the same as those allowed for <code>SCREEN SECTION</code> data items.

</ul> </li>
<li> The  <code>SCROLL</code> option will cause the entire contents of the screen to be scrolled <code>UP</code> or <code>DOWN</code> by the specified number of lines before any value is displayed on the screen. It is syntactically allowable to specify a <code>SCROLL UP</code> clause as well as a <code>SCROLL DOWN</code> clause. In such an instance, it is the last one specified that will be honoured. If no <code>LINES</code> specification is made, <code>1 LINE</code> will be assumed. </li>
<li> The  <code>TIMEOUT</code> option will cause the <code>ACCEPT</code> to wait no more than the specified number of seconds for input. The wait count may be specified as a positive integer or a numeric data item with a positive value. </li>
<li> The  <code>UPDATE</code> option will enable the supplied data field to be updated having been displayed on screen prior to data being entered by overwriting, if needed. When this option is <i>not</i> used the input field is cleared prior to input and this is the default but can be changed by the use of compiler steering command -faccept-with-update that can be input when starting the compiler or included in the configuration file e.g., default.conf used when selected by default <samp>-std=default</samp>.

<li> The actual key pressed to generate a function key (<code class="key">F<var>n</var></code>) will depend on the type of terminal device you’re using (PC, Macintosh, VT100, etc.) and what type of enhanced display driver was configured with the version of GnuCOBOL you’re using. <p>For example, on a GnuCOBOL build for a Windows PC using MinGW and “PDCurses”, <code class="key">F1</code>–<code class="key">F12</code> are the actual F-keys on the PC keyboard, <code class="key">F<var>13</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>24</var></code> are entered by shifting the F-keys, <code class="key">F<var>25</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>36</var></code> are entered by holding Ctrl while pressing an F-key and <code class="key">F<var>37</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>48</var></code> are entered by holding Alt while pressing an F-key. On the other hand, a GnuCOBOL implementation built for Windows using Cygwin and NCurses treats the PCs <code class="key">F<var>1</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>12</var></code> keys as the actual <code class="key">F<var>1</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>12</var></code>, while shifted F-keys will enter <code class="key">F<var>11</var></code>–<code class="key">F<var>2</var></code>0. With Cygwin/NCurses, Ctrl- and Alt-modified F-keys aren’t recognized, nor are <code class="key">Shift-F<var>11</var></code> or <code class="key">Shift-F<var>12</var></code>. </p> <p>Mouse Key codes are populated only if mouse management has been enabled. To enable mouse it is first necessary to set <code>COB_MOUSE_FLAGS</code> (either externally via terminal command, or internally via <code>SET ENVIRONMENT</code> to the applicable ?mouse mask? (specifying which activities you wish the program to detect). Here is an example of setting the mask from a COBOL program: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">COPY <samp>screenio.cpy</samp>.

01  mouse-flags PIC 9(4).

...

    COMPUTE mouse-flags = COB-AUTO-MOUSE-HANDLING
                        + COB-ALLOW-LEFT-DOWN
                        + COB-ALLOW-MIDDLE-DOWN
                        + COB-ALLOW-RIGHT-DOWN

    SET ENVIRONMENT "COB_MOUSE_FLAGS" TO <var>mouse-flags</var>.

</pre>
</div> </li>
<li> Once that has been done, every (extended) ACCEPT, will return a value in COB_CRT_STATUS reflecting mouse activity, when such activity occurs. The applicable values are shown in screenio.cpy under ?Exception keys for mouse handling?. If you define a variable in SPECIAL NAMES as follows: <pre class="verbatim">SPECIAL-NAMES.
   CURSOR IS data-name.   *&gt; where data-name is PIC 9(4) or 9(6).
</pre> </li>
<li> The cursor or mouse position will be returned as well. The position is expressed as row and column (rrcc or rrrccc). </li>
<li> Numeric keypad keys are not recognizable on Windows MinGW/PDCurses builds of GnuCOBOL, regardless of the number lock settings.

<li> If used, <var>expression-1</var> must be an arithmetic expression with a non-zero positive integer value. </li>
<li> If used, <var>identifier-1</var> should be an 01-level item defined in working-storage or local-storage with the <code>BASED</code> (see <a href="#BASED">BASED</a>) attribute.

<li> If used, <var>identifier-2</var> should be a <code>POINTER</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) data item. </li>
<li> The optional  <code>RETURNING</code> clause will return the address of the allocated memory block into the specified <code>USAGE POINTER</code> <var>identifier-2</var> data item. When this option is used, knowledge of the originally-requested size of the allocated memory block will be retained by the program in case a <code>FREE</code> (see <a href="#FREE">FREE</a>) statement is ever issued against <var>identifier-2</var>. </li>
<li> When the <var>identifier-1</var> option is used in conjunction with  <code>INITIALIZED</code> (or its internationalized alternative <code>INITIALISED</code>), the allocated memory block will be initialized as if an <code>INITIALIZE <var>identifier-1</var> WITH FILLER ALL TO VALUE THEN TO DEFAULT</code> (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) were executed. </li>
<li> When the <code><var>expression-1</var> CHARACTERS</code> option is used, <code>INITIALIZED</code> will initialize the allocated memory block to binary zeros. If <code>INITIALIZED</code> is not used, the initial contents of allocated memory will be left to whatever rules of memory allocation are in effect for the operating system the program is running under. </li>
<li> There are two basic ways in which this statement is used. The simplest is: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">ALLOCATE My-01-Item
</pre>
</div> <p>With this form, a block of storage equal in size to the defined size of My-01-Item (which must have been defined with the <code>BASED</code> attribute) will be allocated. The address of that block of storage will become the base address of My-01-Item so that it and its subordinate data items become usable within the program. </p> <p>A second (and equivalent) approach is: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">ALLOCATE LENGTH OF My-01-Item CHARACTERS RETURNING The-Pointer
SET ADDRESS OF My-01-Item TO The-Pointer
</pre>
</div> </li>
<li> With this form My-01-Item can either be defined with the <code>BASED</code> attribute or be defined in LINKAGE SECTION. Instead of LENGTH OF My-01-Item you may also use a size smaller to the maximum field size as long as you ensure that the complete field is never used. </li>
<li> Referencing a <code>BASED</code> data item either before its storage has been allocated or after its storage has been released (via the <code>FREE</code> statement) will lead to “unpredictable results”. That’s how reference manuals and standards specifications talk about this situation. In the author’s experience, the results are all too predictable: the program aborts from an attempt to reference an unallocated area of memory. </li>

</pre>  <p>The <code>CALL</code> statement is used to transfer control to a subroutine. See <a href="#Sub_002dProgramming">Sub-Programming</a>, for the specifics of using subprograms with GnuCOBOL programs. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>BY</code>, <code>IS</code> and <code>ON</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The reserved words <code>EXCEPTION</code> and <code>OVERFLOW</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> The reserved words <code>GIVING</code> and <code>RETURNING</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> The expectation is that the subroutine will eventually return control back to the calling program, at which point the <code>CALL</code>ing program will resume execution starting with the statement immediately following the <code>CALL</code>. Subprograms are not required to return to their callers, however, and are free to halt program execution if they wish. </li>
<li> The <var>mnemonic-name-1</var> /  <code>STATIC</code> /  <code>STDCALL</code> option, if used, affects the linkage conventions that will be used to the subroutine being called, as follows: <dl compact> <dt><code>STATIC</code></dt> <dd>
<p>causes the linkage to the subroutine to be performed in such a way as to require the subroutine to be statically-linked with the calling program. Note that this enables static-linking to be used on a subroutine-by-subroutine selective basis. </p> </dd> <dt><code>STDCALL</code></dt> <dd>
<p>allows system standard calling conventions (as opposed to GnuCOBOL calling conventions) to be used when calling a subroutine. The definition of what constitutes “system standard” may vary from operating system to operating system. Use of this requires special knowledge about the linkage requirements of subroutines you are intending to <code>CALL</code>. Subroutines written in GnuCOBOL do not need this option. </p> </dd> <dt><var>mnemonic-name-1</var></dt> <dd>
<p>allows a custom defined calling convention to be used. Such mnemonic names are defined using the <code>CALL-CONVENTION</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) clause. That clause associates a decimal integer value with <var>mnemonic-name-1</var> such that the individual bits set on or off in the binary equivalent of the integer affect linkage to the subroutine as described in the following chart. Those rows of the chart marked with a “No” in the <b>Supported</b> column represent bit positions (switch settings) in the integer value that are currently accepted (to provide compatibility to other COBOL implementations) if coded, but are otherwise unsupported. </p> <p>Note that bit 0 is the right-most bit in the binary value. </p> <table> <thead><tr>

</dd> </dl> </li>
<li> The value of <var>literal-1</var> or <var>identifier-1</var> is the entry-point of the subprogram you wish to call. </li>
<li> When you call a subroutine using <var>identifier-1</var>, you are forcing the runtime system to call a dynamically-loadable subprogram. The contents of <var>identifier-1</var> will be the entry-point name within that module. If this is the <i>first</i> call to any entry-point within the module being made at run-time, the contents of <var>identifier-1</var> must be the primary entry-point name of the module (which must also match the filename, minus any OS-mandated extension) of the executable file comprising the module). </li>
<li> You can force the GnuCOBOL runtime system to pre-load all dynamically-loaded modules that could ever be called by the program, at the time the program starts executing. This is accomplished through the use of the   <code>COB_PRE_LOAD</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>). If used, this will only pre-load those modules invoked via <code>CALL <var>literal-1</var></code>, as the runtime contents of <var>identifier-1</var> cannot be predicted. </li>
<li> If the subprogram being called is a GnuCOBOL program, and if that program had the <code>INITIAL</code> (see <a href="#IDENTIFICATION-DIVISION">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</a>) attribute specified on its <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> clause, all of the subprogram’s data division data will be restored to its initial state each time the subprogram is executed, regardless of which entry-point within the subprogram is being referenced. <p>This [re]-initialization behaviour will <i>always</i> apply to any subprogram’s local-storage (if any), regardless of the use (or not) of <code>INITIAL</code>. </p> </li>
<li> The  <code>USING</code> clause defines a list of arguments that may be passed from the calling program to the subprogram. The manner in which any given argument is passed to the subroutine depends upon the <code>BY</code> clause (if any) coded (or implied) for that argument, as follows: <dl compact> <dt><code>BY REFERENCE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>passes the <i>address</i> of the argument to the subprogram. If the subprogram changes the contents of that argument, the change will be “visible” to the calling program. </p> </dd> <dt><code>BY CONTENT</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>passes the <i>address</i> of a <i>copy</i> of the argument to the subprogram. If the subprogram changes the value of such an argument, the change only affects the copy back in the calling program, not the original version. </p> </dd> <dt><code>BY VALUE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>passes the <i>actual numeric value</i> of the literal or identifiers contents as the argument. This feature exists to provide compatibility with C, C++ and other languages and would not normally be used when calling GnuCOBOL subprograms. Only numeric literals or numeric data items should be passed in this manner. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>If an argument lacks a <code>BY</code> clause, the most-recently encountered <code>BY</code> specification on that <code>CALL</code> statement will be assumed. If the first argument specified on a <code>CALL</code> lacks a <code>BY</code> clause, <code>BY REFERENCE</code> will be assumed. </p> </li>
<li> No more than 251 arguments may be passed to a subroutine, unless the GnuCOBOL compiler was built with a specifically different argument limit specified for it. If you have access to the GnuCOBOL source code, you may adjust this limit by changing the value of the <code>COB_MAX_FIELD_PARAMS</code> in the <samp>call.c</samp> file (found in the <samp>libcob</samp> folder) as well as the last shown <code>#if MAX_CALL_FIELD_PARAMS</code> statement before you run <code>make</code> to build the compiler and run-time library. </li>
<li> The  <code>RETURNING</code> clause allows you to specify a numeric data item into which the subroutine should return a numeric value. If you use this clause on the <code>CALL</code>, the subroutine should include a <code>RETURNING</code> (see <a href="#PROCEDURE-DIVISION-RETURNING">PROCEDURE DIVISION RETURNING</a>) clause on its procedure division header. Of course, a subroutine may pass a value of any kind back in any argument passed <code>BY REFERENCE</code>. </li>
<li> The optional <code>ON OVERFLOW</code> and <code>NOT ON OVERFLOW</code> clauses (or <code>ON EXCEPTION</code> and <code>NOT ON EXCEPTION</code> — they are interchangeable) may be used to detect and react to the failure or success, respectively, of an attempt to <code>CALL</code> the subroutine. Failure, in this context, is defined as the inability to either locate or load the object code of the subroutine at execution time. See <a href="#ON-OVERFLOW-_002b-NOT-ON-OVERFLOW">ON OVERFLOW + NOT ON OVERFLOW</a>, for additional information. </li>
<li> Call also supports using an entry point stored in a <code>PROGRAM-POINTER</code>, avoiding the dynamic runtime lookup. GnuCOBOL keeps a cache of lookups during a program run. Repeated use of a named function does not suffer much penalty, but <code>PROGRAM-POINTER</code> will be just that little bit faster. To set a <code>PROGRAM-POINTER</code> use <code>SET <var>program-reference</var> TO ENTRY "<var>name</var>"</code> (or get the address from an API, and take part in callback programming). </li>
<li> An extension of <code>CALL</code> allows a call to a <var>Program-Pointer-1</var> which is preset using <code>SET <var>program-pointer-1</var> TO ENTRY <var>x</var></code>. Additional the <code>RETURNING</code> clause may return a data pointer or a <code>PROGRAM-POINTER</code> </li>

<ol> <li> The <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> statement is not legal anywhere within a user-defined function. </li>
<li> The <code>EXIT FUNCTION</code> statement cannot be used anywhere within a subroutine. </li>
<li> Neither <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> nor <code>EXIT FUNCTION</code> may be used within a <code>USE GLOBAL</code> routine in <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>). </li>
<li> The following points describe the <code>EXIT</code> statement with none of the optional clauses: <ol> <li> When this form of an <code>EXIT</code> statement is used, it must be the only statement in the procedure (paragraph or section) in which it occurs. This is <i>not</i> enforced in GnuCOBOL. </li>
<li> This usage of the <code>EXIT</code> statement simply provides a common “GO TO” end point for a series of procedures, as may be seen in the following example: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  Switches.

<li> If an <code>EXIT PARAGRAPH</code> statement or <code>EXIT SECTION</code> statement resides <i>outside</i> the scope of a procedural <code>PERFORM</code>, control simply transfers to the first executable statement in the next paragraph (<code>EXIT PARAGRAPH</code>) or section (<code>EXIT SECTION</code>). </li>
<li> The following shows how the previous example could have been coded without a <code>GO TO</code> by utilizing an <code>EXIT PARAGRAPH</code> statement. <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  Switches.

<li> The following points apply to the <code>EXIT PERFORM</code> and <code>EXIT PERFORM CYCLE</code> statements: <ol> <li> The <code>EXIT PERFORM</code> and <code>EXIT PERFORM CYCLE</code> statements are intended to be used in conjunction with an in-line <code>PERFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#Inline-PERFORM">Inline PERFORM</a>). </li>
<li> An <code>EXIT PERFORM CYCLE</code> statement will terminate the current iteration of the in-line <code>PERFORM</code>, giving control to any <code>TIMES</code>, <code>VARYING</code> and/or <code>UNTIL</code> clauses for them to determine if another cycle needs to be performed. </li>
<li> An <code>EXIT PERFORM</code> statement will terminate the in-line PERFORM outright, transferring control to the first statement following the <code>END-PERFORM</code> (if there is one) or to the next sentence following the <code>PERFORM</code> if there is no <code>END-PERFORM</code>. </li>

<li> An <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> statement returns control back to the statement following the <code>CALL</code> (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>) of the subprogram.

<li> If executed by a main program, neither the <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> nor <code>EXIT FUNCTION</code> statements will take any action. </li>
<li> The COBOL2002 standard has made a common extension to the COBOL language — the <code>GOBACK</code> statement (see <a href="#GOBACK">GOBACK</a>) — a standard language element; the <code>GOBACK</code> statement should be strongly considered as the preferred alternative to both <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> and <code>EXIT FUNCTION</code> for new subprograms. </li>

<li> The <code>DETAIL</code> group which is defined for <var>report-name-1</var> <i>will</i> be processed but will not actually be presented to any report page.

<li> From the sequence of <var>identifier-1</var> data items specified on the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement, a list of initialized fields referred to as the <i>field list</i> in the remainder of this section, will include: <ol> <li> Every <var>identifier-1</var> that is an elementary item, including any that may have the <code>REDEFINES</code> (see <a href="#REDEFINES">REDEFINES</a>) clause in their descriptions. </li>
<li> Every non-<code>FILLER</code> 3elementary item subordinate to <var>identifier-1</var>, provided that elementary item neither contains a <code>REDEFINES</code> clause in its definition nor belongs to a group item <i>subordinate to</i> <var>identifier-1</var> which contains a <code>REDEFINES</code> clause in its definition. </li>

</ol> </li>
<li> Once a field list has been determined, each item in that field list will be initialized as if an individual <code>MOVE</code> (see <a href="#MOVE">MOVE</a>) statement to that effect had been coded. The rules for initialization are as follows: </li>
<li> If no  <code>VALUE</code>,  <code>REPLACING</code> or  <code>DEFAULT</code> clauses are coded, each member of the field list will be initialized as if the figurative constant <code>ZERO</code> (if the field list item is numeric or numeric-edited) or <code>SPACES</code> (otherwise) were being moved to it. </li>
<li> If a <code>VALUE</code> clause is specified on the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement, each qualifying member of the field list having a compile-time <code>VALUE</code> (see <a href="#VALUE">VALUE</a>) specified in its definition will be initialized to that value. Field list members with <code>VALUE</code> clauses will qualify for this treatment as follows: <ol> <li> If the <code>ALL</code> keyword was specified on the <code>VALUE</code> clause, all members of the field list with <code>VALUE</code> clauses will qualify. </li>
<li> If <var>category-name-1</var> is specified instead of <code>ALL</code>, only those members of the field list with <code>VALUE</code> clauses that also meet the criteria set down for the specified <var>category-name</var> (see the list above) will qualify. </li>
<li> If you need to apply <code>VALUE</code> initialization to multiple <var>category-name-1</var> values, you will need to use multiple <code>INITIALIZE</code> statements. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If a <code>REPLACING</code> clause is specified on the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement, each qualifying member of the field list that was not already initialized by a <code>VALUE</code> clause, if any, will be initialized to the specified <var>literal-1</var> or <var>identifier-1</var> value. <p>Only those as-yet uninitialized list members meeting the criteria set forth for the specified <var>category-name-2</var> will qualify for this initialization. </p> <p>If you need to apply <code>REPLACING</code> initialization to multiple <var>category-name-2</var> values, you may repeat the syntax after the reserved word <code>REPLACING</code>, as necessary. </p> </li>
<li> If a <code>DEFAULT</code> clause is specified, any remaining uninitialized members of the field list will be initialized according to the default for their class (numeric and numeric-edited are initialized to <code>ZERO</code>, all others are initialized to <code>SPACES</code>). </li>
<li> The following example may help your understanding of how the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement works. The sample code makes use of the <code>COBDUMP</code> program to dump the storage that is (or is not) being initialized.

<li> All literals and identifiers must be explicitly or implicitly defined as alphanumeric or alphabetic. </li>
<li> If <var>function-reference-1</var> is specified, it must be an invocation of an intrinsic function that returns a <i>string</i> result. Additionally, only the <code>TALLYING</code> clause may be specified. </li>
<li> If <var>literal-1</var> is specified, only the <code>TALLYING</code> clause may be specified. </li>
<li> Whichever is specified — <var>literal-1</var>, <var>identifier-1</var> or <var>function-reference-1</var> — that item will be referred to in the discussions that follows as the ’<i>inspect subject</i>’. </li>
<li> The three optional clauses control the operation of this statement as follows: <ol> <li> The <code>CONVERTING</code> clause replaces one or more individual characters found in the inspect subject with a different character in much the same manner as is possible with the <code>TRANSFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#TRANSFORM">TRANSFORM</a>). </li>
<li> The <code>REPLACING</code> clause replaces one or more sub strings located in the inspect subject with a different, but equally-sized replacement sub string. If you need to replace a sub string with another of a <i>different</i> length, consider using either the <code>SUBSTITUTE</code> intrinsic function (see <a href="#SUBSTITUTE">SUBSTITUTE</a>) or the <code>SUBSTITUTE-CASE</code> intrinsic function (see <a href="#SUBSTITUTE_002dCASE">SUBSTITUTE-CASE</a>). </li>
<li> The <code>TALLYING</code> clause counts the number of occurrences of one or more strings of characters in the inspect subject. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The optional <code>INITIAL</code> clauses may be used to limit the range of characters in the inspect subject that the <code>CONVERTING</code>, <code>REPLACING</code> or <code>TALLYING</code> instruction in which they occur will apply. We call this the ’<i>target range</i>’ of the inspect subject. The target range is defined as follows: <ol> <li> If there is no <code>INITIAL</code> clause specified, the target range is the entire inspect subject. </li>
<li> Either a <code>BEFORE</code> phrase, an <code>AFTER</code> phrase or both may be specified. They may be specified in any order. </li>
<li> The starting point of the target range will be the first character following the sub string identified by the <code>AFTER</code> specification. The ending point will be the last character immediately preceding the sub string identified by the <code>BEFORE</code> specification. </li>
<li> If no <code>AFTER</code> is specified, the first character position of the target range will be character position #1 of the inspect subject. </li>
<li> If no <code>BEFORE</code> is specified, the last character position of the target range will be the last character position of the inspect subject. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points apply to the use of the <code>TALLYING</code> clause: <ol> <li> While there will typically be only be a single set of counting instructions on an <code>INSPECT</code>: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">INSPECT Character-String
    TALLYING C-ABC FOR ALL "ABC"
</pre>
</div> <p>There could be multiple counting instructions specified: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">INSPECT Character-String
    TALLYING C-ABC FOR ALL "ABC"
             C-BCDE FOR ALL "BCDE"
</pre>
</div> <p>When there <i>are</i> multiple instructions, the one specified first will take priority over the one specified second, (and so forth) as the <code>INSPECT</code> proceeds forward through the inspect subject, character-by-character. </p> <p>With the above example, if the inspect subject were <code>--ABCDEF----BCDEF--</code>, the final result of the counting would be that <code>C-ABC</code> would be incremented by 1 while <code>C-BCDE</code> would be incremented only once; although the human eye clearly sees two ‘<samp>BCDE</samp>’ sequences, the <code>INSPECT ... TALLYING</code> would only “see” the second — the first would have been processed by the first (higher-priority) counting instruction. </p> </li>
<li> Each set of counting instructions contains the following information: <ol> <li> A target range, specified by the presence of an <code>AFTER INITIAL</code> and/or <code>BEFORE INITIAL</code> clause; the rules for specifying target ranges were covered previously. </li>
<li> A Target Sub string — this is a sequence of characters to be located somewhere in the inspect subject and counted. Target sub strings may be defined as a literal value (figurative constants are allowed) or by the contents of an identifier. If the target sub string is specified as a figurative constant, it will be assumed to have a length of one (‘<samp>1</samp>’) character. The keywords before the literal or identifier control how many target sub strings could be identified from that replacement instruction, as follows: <p><code>ALL</code> — identifies every possible target sub string that occurs within the target range. There are three occurrences of <code>ALL 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>. </p> <p><code>LEADING</code> — identifies only an occurrence of the target sub string found either at the first character position of the target range or immediately following a previously-found occurrence. There are no occurrences of <code>LEADING 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>, but there is one occurrence of <code>LEADING 'a'</code> (the first character). </p> <p><code>TRAILING</code> — identifies only an occurrence of the target sub string found either at the very end of the target range or toward the end, followed by nothing but other occurrences. There are no occurrences of <code>LEADING 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>, but there are two occurrences of <code>TRAILING 'd'</code>. </p> <p>The <code>CHARACTERS</code> option will match any one single character, regardless of what that character is. </p>
</li>
</ol> </li>
<li> <var>identifier-2</var> will be incremented by 1 each time the target sub string is found within the target range of the inspect subject. The <code>INSPECT</code> statement <i>will not</i> zero-out <var>identifier-2</var> at the start of execution of the <code>INSPECT</code> — it is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that all <var>identifier-2</var> data items are properly initialized to the desired starting values prior to execution of the <code>INSPECT</code>. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points apply to the use of the <code>REPLACING</code> clause: <ol> <li> While there will typically be only be a single set of replacement instructions on an <code>INSPECT</code>: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">INSPECT Character-String
    REPLACING ALL "ABC" BY "DEF"
</pre>
</div> <p>There could be multiple replacement instructions: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">INSPECT Character-String
    REPLACING ALL "ABC" BY "DEF"
              ALL "BCDE" BY "WXYZ"
</pre>
</div> <p>When there <i>are</i> multiple replacement instructions, the one specified first will take priority over the one specified second, (and so forth) as the <code>INSPECT</code> proceeds forward through the inspect subject, character-by-character. </p> <p>With the above example, if the inspect subject were <code>--ABCDEF----BCDEF--</code>, the final result of the replacement would be <code>--DEFDEF----WXYZF--</code>. </p> </li>
<li> Each set of replacement instructions contains the following information: <ol> <li> A target range, specified by the presence of an <code>AFTER INITIAL</code> and/or <code>BEFORE INITIAL</code> clause; the rules for specifying target ranges were covered previously. </li>
<li> A Target Sub string — this is a sequence of characters to be located somewhere in the inspect subject and subsequently replaced with a new value. Target sub strings, which are specified before the <code>BY</code> keyword, may be defined as a literal value (figurative constants are allowed) or by the contents of an identifier. If the target sub string is specified as a figurative constant, it will be assumed to have a length of one (‘<samp>1</samp>’) character. The keywords before the literal or identifier control how many target sub strings could be identified from that replacement instruction, as follows: <p><code>ALL</code> — identifies every possible target sub string that occurs within the target range. There are three occurrences of <code>ALL 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>. </p> <p><code>FIRST</code> — the first occurrence of the target sub string found within the target range. The <code>FIRST 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code> would be the one found between the ‘<samp>a</samp>’ and ‘<samp>b</samp>’ characters. </p> <p><code>LEADING</code> — an occurrence of the target sub string found either at the first character position of the target range or immediately following a previously-found occurrence. There are no occurrences of <code>LEADING 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>, but there is one occurrence of <code>LEADING 'a'</code> (the first character). </p> <p><code>TRAILING</code> — an occurrence of the target sub string found either at the very end of the target range or toward the end, followed by nothing but other occurrences. There are no occurrences of <code>LEADING 'XX'</code> found in <code>aXXabbXXccXXdd</code>, but there are two occurrences of <code>TRAILING 'd'</code>. </p> <p>The <code>CHARACTERS</code> option will match any one single character. When you use this option, the replacement sub string (see the next item) must be exactly one character in length. </p> </li>
<li> A Replacement Sub string — this is the sequence of characters that should replace the target sub string. Replacement sub strings are specified after the <code>BY</code> keyword. They too may be specified as a literal, either with or without an <code>ALL</code> prefix (again, figurative constants are allowed) or the value of an identifier. If a figurative constant is coded, the <code>ALL</code> keyword will be assumed, even if it wasn’t specified. Literals without <code>ALL</code> will either be truncated or padded with spaces on the right to match the length of the target sub string. Literals with <code>ALL</code> or figurative constants will be repeated as necessary to match the length of the target sub string. Identifiers specified as replacement sub strings must be defined with a length equal to that of the target sub string. </li>
</ol> </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> When both <code>REPLACING</code> and <code>TALLYING</code> are specified: <ol> <li> The <code>INSPECT</code> statement will make a single pass through the sequence of characters comprising the inspect subject. As the pointer to the current inspect target character reaches a point where it falls within the explicit or implicit target ranges specified on the operational instructions of the two clauses, the actions specified by those instructions will become eligible to be taken. As the character pointer reaches a point where it falls past the end of target ranges, the instructions belonging to those target ranges will become disabled. </li>
<li> At any point in time, there may well be multiple<code>REPLACING</code> and/or <code>TALLYING</code> operational instructions active. Only one of the <code>TALLYING</code> and one of the <code>REPLACING</code> instructions (if any) can be executed for any one character pointer position. In each case, it will be the first of the instructions in each category that produces a match with its target string specification. </li>
<li> When both a <code>TALLYING</code> and a <code>REPLACING</code> instruction have been selected for execution, the <code>TALLYING</code> instruction will be executed first. This guarantees that <code>TALLYING</code> will compute occurrences based upon the <i>initial</i> value of the inspect subject before any replacements occur. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points apply to the use of the <code>CONVERTING</code> clause: <ol> <li> A <code>CONVERTING</code> clause performs a series of single-character substitutions against a data item in much the same manner as is possible with the <code>TRANSFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#TRANSFORM">TRANSFORM</a>). </li>
<li> Unlike the <code>TALLYING</code> and <code>REPLACING</code> clauses, both of which may have multiple operations specified, there may be only one <code>CONVERTING</code> operation per <code>INSPECT</code>. </li>
<li> If the length of <var>literal-7</var> or <var>identifier-8</var> (the “from” string) <i>exceeds</i> the length of <var>literal-8</var> or <var>identifier-9</var> (the “to” string), then the “to” string will be assumed to be padded to the right with enough spaces to make it the same length as the “from” string. </li>
<li> If the length of the “from” string <i>is less than</i> the length of the “to” string, then the “to” string will be truncated to the length of the “from” string. </li>
<li> Each character, in turn, within the “from” string will be searched for in the target range of the inspect subject. Each located occurrence will be replaced by the corresponding character of the “to” string. </li>

<li> The reserved words <code>THRU</code> and <code>THROUGH</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> GnuCOBOL always behaves as if the <code>WITH DUPLICATES IN ORDER</code> clause is specified, even if it isn’t. <p>While any COBOL implementation’s sort or merge facilities guarantee that records with duplicate key values will be in proper sequence with regard to other records with different key values, they generally make no promises as to the resulting relative sequence of records having duplicate key values with one another. </p> <p>Some COBOL implementations provide this optional clause to force their sort and merge facilities to retain duplicate key-value records in their original input sequence, relative to one another. </p> </li>
<li> The <var>sort-file-1</var> named on the <code>MERGE</code> statement must be defined using a sort description (<code>SD</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>)). This file is referred to in the remainder of this discussion as the <i>merge work file</i>. </li>
<li> Each <var>file-name-1</var>, <var>file-name-2</var> and <var>file-name-3</var> (if specified) must reference <code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-LINE-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</a>) or <code>ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</a>) files. These files must be defined using a file description (<code>FD</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>)). </li>
<li> The <var>identifier-1</var> … field(s) must be defined as field(s) within a record of <var>sort-file-1</var>. </li>
<li> The record descriptions of <var>file-name-1</var>, <var>file-name-2</var>, <var>file-name-3</var> (if any) and <var>sort-file-1</var> are assumed to be identical in layout and size. While the actual data names used for fields in these files’ records may differ, the structure of records, <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) of fields, <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) of fields, size of fields and location of fields within the records should match field-by-field across all files, at least as far as the <code>KEY</code> fields are concerned. </li>
<li> A common programming technique when using the <code>MERGE</code> statement is to define the records of all files involved as simple elementary items of the form <code>01 record-name PIC X(n).</code> where n is the record size. The only file where records are actually described in detail would then be <var>sort-file-1</var>. </li>
<li> The following rules apply to the files named on the <code>USING</code> clause: <ol> <li> None of them may be open at the time the <code>MERGE</code> is executed. </li>
<li> Each of those files is assumed to be already sorted according to the specifications set forth on the <code>MERGE</code> statement’s  <code>KEY</code> clause. </li>
<li> No two of those files may be referenced on a <code>SAME RECORD AREA</code> (see <a href="#SAME-RECORD-AREA">SAME RECORD AREA</a>), <code>SAME SORT AREA</code> or <code>SAME SORT-MERGE AREA</code> statement. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The merging process is as follows: <ol> <li> As the <code>MERGE</code> statement begins execution, the first record in each of the  <code>USING</code> files is read automatically. </li>
<li> As the <code>MERGE</code> statement executes, the current record from each of the <code>USING</code> files is examined and compared to each other according to the rules set forth by the <code>KEY</code> clause and the alphabet (see <a href="#Alphabet_002dName_002dClause">Alphabet-Name-Clause</a>) specified on the  <code>COLLATING SEQUENCE</code> clause. The record that should be next in sequence will be written to the merge work file and the <code>USING</code> file from which that record came will be read so that its next record is available. As end-of-file conditions are reached on <code>USING</code> files, those files will be excluded from further processing — processing continues with the remaining files until all the contents of all of them have been exhausted. </li>
<li> After the merge work file has been populated, the merged data will be written to each <var>file-name-3</var> if the  <code>GIVING</code> clause was specified, or will be processed by utilizing an  <code>OUTPUT PROCEDURE</code>. </li>
<li> When <code>GIVING</code> is specified, none of the <var>file-name-3</var> files can be open at the time the <code>MERGE</code> statement is executed. </li>
<li> When an output procedure is used, the procedure(s) specified on the <code>OUTPUT PROCEDURE</code> clause will be invoked as if by a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> (see <a href="#Procedural-PERFORM">Procedural PERFORM</a>) statement with no <code>VARYING</code>, <code>TIMES</code> or <code>UNTIL</code> options specified. Merged records may be read from the merge work file — one at a time — within the output procedure using the <code>RETURN</code> (see <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>) statement. <p>A <code>GO TO</code> statement (see <a href="#GO-TO">GO TO</a>) that transfers control out of the output procedure will terminate the <code>MERGE</code> statement but allows the program to continue executing from the point where the <code>GO TO</code> statement transferred control to. Once an output procedure has been “aborted” using a <code>GO TO</code> it cannot be resumed, and the contents of the merge work file are lost. You may, however, re-execute the <code>MERGE</code> statement itself. <i>Using a</i> <code>GO TO</code> statement <i>to prematurely terminate a merge, or re-starting a previously-cancelled merge is not considered good programming style and should be avoided</i>. </p> <p>An output procedure should be terminated in the same way a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> statement would be. Usually, this action will be taken once the <code>RETURN</code> statement indicates that all records in the merge work file have been processed, but termination could occur at <i>any</i> time — via an <code>EXIT</code> statement (see <a href="#EXIT">EXIT</a>) — if required. </p> <p>Neither a file-based <code>SORT</code> statement (see <a href="#File_002dBased-SORT">File-Based SORT</a>) nor another <code>MERGE</code> statement may be executed within the scope of the procedures comprising the output procedure unless those statements utilize a different sort or merge work file. </p> </li>
<li> Once the output procedure terminates, or the last <var>file-name-3</var> file has been populated with merged data, the output phase — and the <code>MERGE</code> statement itself — is complete. </li>

<li> Both <var>procedure-name-1</var> and <var>procedure-name-2</var> must be procedure division sections or paragraphs defined in the same program as the <code>PERFORM</code> statement. If <var>procedure-name-2</var> is specified, it must follow <var>procedure-name-1</var> in the program’s source code. </li>
<li> The  <em>perform scope</em> is defined as being the statements within <var>procedure-name-1</var>, the statements within <var>procedure-name-2</var> and all statements in all procedures defined between them. </li>
<li> <var>literal-1</var> must be a numeric literal or a reference to a function that returns a numeric value. The value must be an integer greater than zero. </li>
<li> <var>identifier-1</var> must be an elementary un-edited numeric data item with an integer value greater than zero. </li>
<li> Without the  <code>UNTIL</code>,  <code>UNTIL EXIT</code>,  <code>TIMES</code>, <i>VARYING-Clause</i> (see <a href="#VARYING">VARYING</a>) or  <code>FOREVER</code> clauses, the code within the perform scope will be executed once, after which control will return to the statement following the <code>PERFORM</code>. </li>
<li> The <code>FOREVER</code> option will repeatedly execute the code within the perform scope with no conditions defined for termination of the repetition — it will be up to the programmer to include an <code>EXIT SECTION</code> statement (see <a href="#EXIT">EXIT</a>) or <code>EXIT PARAGRAPH</code> statement within the procedure(s) being performed that will break out of the loop. </li>
<li> The <code>TIMES</code> option will repeat the execution of the code within the perform scope a fixed number of times. When the <code>PERFORM</code> statement begins execution, an internal repeat counter (not accessible to the programmer) will be set to the value of <var>literal-1</var> or the value within <var>identifier-1</var>. <p>If the counter has a value greater than zero, the statement(s) within the <code>PERFORM</code> scope will be executed, after which the counter will be decremented by 1 with each repetition.

<li> The <code>UNTIL <var>conditional-expression-1</var></code> option will repeat the code within the perform scope until the specified conditional expression evaluates to a <code>TRUE</code> value. </li>
<li> The optional  <code>WITH TEST</code> clause will control whether <code>UNTIL</code> testing occurs <code>BEFORE</code> the statements within the perform scope are executed on each iteration (creating the possibility — if <var>conditional-expression-1</var> is initially <code>TRUE</code> — that the statements within the perform scope will never be executed) or  <code>AFTER</code> (guaranteeing the statements within the perform scope will be executed at least once). <p>The default, if this clause is absent, is <code>WITH TEST BEFORE</code>. </p> <p>This clause may not be coded when the <code>TIMES</code> clause is used. </p> </li>
<li> The optional <code><var>VARYING-Clause</var></code> is a mechanism that creates an advanced loop-management mechanism complete with one or more numeric data items being automatically incremented (or decremented) on each loop iteration as well as the termination control of an <code>UNTIL</code> clause.

<li> The statements within the perform scope will be executed. If a <code>GO TO</code> executed within the perform scope transfers control to a point outside the perform scope, processing of the <code>PERFORM</code> will halt. </li>
<li> When the statements within the perform scope terminate the loop iteration, by one of: <ul> <li> allowing the flow of execution to attempt to fall past the last statement in the perform scope </li>

<li> Return to step C. </li>

<li> Most <code><var>VARYING-Clause</var></code>s have no <code>AFTER</code> specified.

<li> At the time the <code>SEARCH</code> statement is executed, the current value of the search index data item will define the starting position in the table where the searching process will begin.

   ~~~~~~~~~~</pre>  <p>The <code>SEARCH ALL</code> statement performs a binary, or half-interval, search against a sorted table. This is generally <i>significantly</i> faster than performing a sequential <code>SEARCH</code> of a table, especially if the table contains a large number of entries. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved word <code>AT</code> is optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> To be eligible for searching via <code>SEARCH ALL</code>: <ol> <li> The <code>OCCURS</code> clause of <var>table-name-1</var> must contain the following elements: <ul> <li> An  <code>INDEXED BY</code> entry to define an implicit search index data item with a <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) of <code>INDEX</code>. </li>
<li> An  <code>ASCENDING KEY</code> or  <code>DESCENDING KEY</code> clause to specify the field within the table by which all entries in the table are sorted. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> Just because the table has one or more <code>KEY</code> clauses doesn’t mean the data is actually <i>in</i> that sequence in the table — the actual sequence of the data <i>must</i> agree with the KEY clause(s)! A table-based <code>SORT</code> (see <a href="#Table-SORT">Table SORT</a>) can prove very useful in this regard. </li>
<li> No two records in the table may have the same <code>KEY</code> field values. If the table has multiple <code>KEY</code> definitions, then no two records in the table may have the same <i>combination</i> of <code>KEY</code> field values. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If rule <i>A</i> is violated, the compiler will reject the <code>SEARCH ALL</code>. If rules <i>B</i> and/or <i>C</i> are violated, there will be no message issued by the compiler, but the run-time results of a <code>SEARCH ALL</code> against the table will probably be incorrect. </li>
<li> The <var>conditional-expression-1</var> should involve the <code>KEY</code> field(s), using the search index (the table’s <code>INDEXED BY</code> index name) as a subscript. </li>
<li> The function of the single, mandatory,  <code>WHEN</code> clause is to compare the key field(s) of the table, as indexed by the search index data item, against whatever literal and/or identifier values you are comparing the key field(s) to in the <var>conditional-expression-1</var> in order to locate the desired entry in the table. The search index will be automatically varied in a manner designed to require the minimum number of tests. </li>
<li> The internal processing of the SEARCH ALL statement begins by setting internal “first” and “last” pointers to the 1<sup>st</sup> and last entry locations of the table. Processing then proceeds as follows: <ol> <li> The entry half-way between “first” and “last” is identified. We’ll call this the “current” entry, and will set its table entry location into <var>index-name-1</var>. </li>
<li> The <var>conditional-expression-1</var> is evaluated. This comparison of the key(s) against the target literal/identifier values will have one of three possible outcomes: <ul> <li> If the key(s) and value(s) match, <var>imperative-statement-2</var> (see <a href="#Imperative-Statement">Imperative Statement</a>) is executed, after which control falls through into the next statement following the <code>SEARCH ALL</code>. </li>
<li> If the key(s) are LESS THAN the value(s), then the table entry being searched for can only occur in the “current” to “last” range of the table, so a new “first” pointer value is set (it will be set to the “current” pointer). </li>
<li> If the key(s) are GREATER THAN the value(s), then the table entry being searched for can only occur in the “first” to “current” range of the table, so a new “last” pointer value is set (it will be set to the “current” pointer). </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> If the new “first” and “last” pointers are different than the old “first” and “last” pointers, there’s more left to be searched, so return to step <i>A</i> and continue. </li>
<li> If the new “first” and “last” pointers are the same as the old “first” and “last” pointers, the table has been exhausted and the entry being searched for cannot be found; <var>imperative-statement-1</var> is executed, after which control falls through into the next statement following the <code>SEARCH ALL</code>. If there is no <code>AT END</code> clause coded, control simply falls into the next statement following the <code>SEARCH ALL</code>. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The net effect of the above algorithm is that only a fraction of the number of elements in the table need ever be tested in order to decide whether or not a particular entry exists. This is because the half the remaining entries in the table are discarded each time an entry is checked. </li>
<li> Computer scientists will compare the two techniques implemented by the <code>SEARCH</code> and <code>SEARCH ALL</code> statements as follows: </li>
<li> When searching a table with <i>N</i> entries, a sequential search will need an average of <i>N/2</i> tests and a worst case of <i>N</i> tests in order to find an entry and <i>N</i> tests to identify that an entry doesn’t exist. </li>
<li> When searching a table with <i>N</i> entries, a binary search will need a worst-case of log2(<i>N</i>) tests in order to find an entry and log2(<i>N</i>) tests to identify that an entry doesn’t exist (<i>N</i> = the number of entries in the table), where <i>log2</i> is the base-2 logarithm function. </li>
</ol> <p>Here’s a more practical view of the difference. Let’s say that a table has 1,000 entries in it. With a sequential search, on average, you’ll have to check 500 of them to find an entry and you’ll have to look at all 1,000 of them to find that an entry doesn’t exist. </p> <p>With a binary search, express the number of entries as a binary number (1,000 = 1111101000), count the number of digits in the result (which is, essentially, what a logarithm is, when rounded up to the next integer — the number of digits a decimal number would have if expressed in the logarithm’s number base). In this case, we end up with 10 — <i>that</i> is the worst-case number of tests required to find an entry or to identify that it doesn’t exist. That’s quite an improvement! </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="SET">7.8.39. SET</h3>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="SET-ENVIRONMENT">7.8.39.1.

</pre> <p>The  <code>DUPLICATES</code> clause is syntactically recognized but is otherwise non-functional. </p> <p>This format of the <code>SORT</code> statement is designed to sort large volumes of data according to one or more key fields. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>IN</code>, <code>IS</code>, <code>KEY</code>, <code>ON</code>, <code>ORDER</code>, <code>SEQUENCE</code> and <code>WITH</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The reserved words <code>THRU</code> and <code>THROUGH</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> GnuCOBOL always behaves as if the <code>WITH DUPLICATES IN ORDER</code> clause is specified, even if it isn’t. <p>While any COBOL implementation’s sort or merge facilities guarantee that records with duplicate key values will be in proper sequence with regard to other records with different key values, they generally make no promises as to the resulting relative sequence of records having duplicate key values with one another. </p> <p>Some COBOL implementations provide this optional clause to force their sort and merge facilities to retain duplicate key-value records in their original input sequence, relative to one another. </p> </li>
<li> The <var>sort-file-1</var> named on the <code>SORT</code> statement must be defined using a sort description (<code>SD</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>)). This file is referred to in the remainder of this discussion as the <i>sort work file</i>. </li>
<li> If specified, <var>file-name-1</var> and <var>file-name-2</var> must reference <code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-LINE-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</a>) or <code>ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</a>) files. These files must be defined using a file description (<code>FD</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>)). The same file(s) may be used for <var>file-name-1</var> and <var>file-name-2</var>. </li>
<li> The <var>identifier-1</var> … field(s) must be defined as field(s) within a record of <var>sort-file-1</var>. </li>
<li> A sort work file is never opened or closed. </li>
<li> The sorting process works in three stages — the Input Stage, the Sort Stage and the Output Stage. </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the Input Stage: <ol> <li> The data to be sorted is loaded into the sort work file either by copying the entire contents of the file(s) named on the <code>USING</code> clause (done automatically by the sort) or by utilizing an input procedure. </li>
<li> When  <code>USING</code> is specified, none of the <var>file-name-1</var> files may be open at the time the <code>SORT</code> statement is executed. </li>
<li> When an input procedure is used, the procedure(s) specified on the  <code>INPUT PROCEDURE</code> clause will be invoked as if by a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#Procedural-PERFORM">Procedural PERFORM</a>) with no <code>VARYING</code>, <code>TIMES</code> or <code>UNTIL</code> options specified. Records will be loaded into the sort work file — one at a time — within the input procedure using the <code>RELEASE</code> statement (see <a href="#RELEASE">RELEASE</a>). This, by the way, is how you could sort the contents of relative or indexed files. <p>A <code>GO TO</code> statement (see <a href="#GO-TO">GO TO</a>) that transfers control out of the input procedure will terminate the <code>SORT</code> statement but allows the program to continue executing from the point where the <code>GO TO</code> statement transferred control to. Once an input procedure has been “aborted” using a <code>GO TO</code> it cannot be resumed, and the contents of the sort work file are lost. You may, however, re-execute the <code>SORT</code> statement itself.<a name="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p> <p>An input procedure should be terminated in the same way a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> statement would be. </p> <p>Neither a another file-based <code>SORT</code> statement nor a <code>MERGE</code> statement may be executed within the input procedure unless those statements utilize a different sort or merge work file. </p> </li>
<li> Once the input procedure terminates, the input phase is complete. </li>
<li> As data is loaded into the sort work file, it is actually being buffered in dynamically-allocated memory. Only if the amount of data to be sorted exceeds the amount of available sort memory (128 MB) will actual disk files be allocated and utilized. There is a   <code>COB_SORT_MEMORY</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) that you may use to allocate more or less memory to the sorting process. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the Sort Stage: <ol> <li> The sort will take place by arranging the data records in the sequence defined by the <code>KEY</code> specification(s) on the <code>SORT</code> statement according to the <code>COLLATING SEQUENCE</code> specified on the <code>SORT</code> (if any) or — if none was defined — the <code>PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE</code> (see <a href="#OBJECT_002dCOMPUTER">OBJECT-COMPUTER</a>). Keys may be any supported data type and <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) except for level-78 or level-88 data items. </li>
<li> For example, let’s assume we’re sorting a series of financial transactions. The SORT statement might look like this: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">SORT Sort-File
    ASCENDING  KEY Transaction-Date
    ASCENDING  KEY Account-Number
    DESCENDING KEY Transaction-Amount
</pre>
</div> <p>The effect of this statement will be to sort all transactions into ascending order of the date the transaction took place (oldest first, newest last). Unless the business running this program is going out of business, there are most-likely many transactions for any given date. Therefore, within each grouping of transactions all with the same date, transactions will be sub-sorted into ascending sequence of the account number the transactions apply to. Since it’s quite possible there might be multiple transactions for an account on any given date, a third level sub-sort will arrange all transactions for the same account on the same date into descending sequence of the actual amount of the transaction (largest first, smallest last). If two or more transactions of $100.00 were recorded for account #12345 on the 31<sup>st</sup> of August 2009, those transactions will be retained in the order in which they were loaded into the sort work file. </p> </li>
<li> Should disk work files be necessary due to the amount of data being sorted, they will be automatically allocated to disk in a folder defined by the   <code>TMPDIR</code> run-time environment variable,   <code>TMP</code> run-time environment variable or   <code>TEMP</code> run-time environment variable run-time environment variables (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) (checked for existence in that sequence). These disk files will be automatically purged upon <code>SORT</code> termination or program execution termination (normal or otherwise). </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the Output Stage: <ol> <li> Once the sort stage is complete, a copy of the sorted data will be written to each <var>file-name-2</var> if the  <code>GIVING</code> clause was specified. None of the <var>file-name-2</var> files can be open at the time the sort is executed. </li>
<li> When an output procedure is used, the procedure(s) specified on the  <code>OUTPUT PROCEDURE</code> clause will be invoked as if by a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#Procedural-PERFORM">Procedural PERFORM</a>) with no <code>VARYING</code>, <code>TIMES</code> or <code>UNTIL</code> options specified. Records will be retrieved from the sort work file — one at a time — within the output procedure using the <code>RETURN</code> statement (see <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>). <p>A <code>GO TO</code> statement (see <a href="#GO-TO">GO TO</a>) that transfers control out of the output procedure will terminate the <code>SORT</code> statement but allows the program to continue executing from the point where the <code>GO TO</code> statement transferred control to. Once an output procedure has been “aborted” using a <code>GO TO</code> it cannot be resumed, and the contents of the sort work file are lost. You may, however, re-execute the <code>SORT</code> statement itself.

<li> The source string will be parsed into sub strings starting from the current character pointer position. Sub strings are identified by using the various delimiter strings specified on the  <code>DELIMITED BY</code> clause as inter-sub string separators. </li>
<li> Using the  <code>ALL</code> option allows a delimiter sequence to be an arbitrarily long sequence of occurrences of the delimiter literal whereas its absence treats each occurrence as a separate delimiter.

<li> Two consecutive delimiter sequences will identify a null sub string. </li>
<li> Identified sub strings will be moved into each destination field in the sequence they are identified; values moved into a destination field will be truncated if the sub string length exceeds the destination field length, or padded with spaces if the destination field length exceeds the sub string length. Both truncation and padding will be controlled by the presence or absence of a <code>JUSTIFIED</code> (see <a href="#JUSTIFIED">JUSTIFIED</a>) clause on the destination field. </li>
<li> Each destination field may have an optional  <code>DELIMITER</code> clause. If a <code>DELIMITER</code> clause is specified, <var>identifier-5</var> will have the delimiter character string used to identify the sub string for the destination field moved into it. If a destination field was not altered (because an insufficient number of sub strings were identified), <var>identifier-5</var> for that destination field will also be unchanged. </li>
<li> Each destination field may have an optional  <code>COUNT</code> clause. If a <code>COUNT</code> clause is specified, <var>identifier-6</var> will have the size of the sub string (in characters) for the destination field moved into it. If a destination field was not altered (because an insufficient number of sub strings were identified), <var>identifier-6</var> for that destination field will also be unchanged. </li>
<li> If a <code>TALLYING</code> clause is coded, <var>identifier-8</var> will be incremented by 1 each time a destination field is populated. </li>
<li> None of <var>identifier-4</var>, <var>identifier-5</var>, <var>identifier-6</var>, <var>identifier-7</var> or <var>identifier-8</var> are initialized by the <code>UNSTRING</code> statement.

<li> <code>UNSTRING</code> processing will cease when one of the following occurs: <ol> <li> The initial value of the current character pointer is less than 1 or greater than the number of character positions in <var>identifier-1</var>, or… </li>
<li> All destination fields have been fully processed </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If event <i>A</i> occurs, none of the destination field contents (or the contents of their <code>DELIMITER</code> or <var>COUNT</var> identifiers) will be changed. </li>
<li> An <i>overflow</i> condition exists if either event <i>A</i> occurs, or if event <i>B</i> occurs with at least one character position in <var>identifier-1</var> not having been processed. </li>

   ~~~~~~~~~</pre>  <p>The <code>WRITE</code> statement writes a new record to an open file. </p>
<ol> <li> The reserved words <code>ADVANCING</code>, <code>AT</code>, <code>KEY</code>, <code>LINE</code>, <code>LINES</code> and <code>WITH</code> are optional and may be omitted. The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program. </li>
<li> The reserved words <code>END-OF-PAGE</code> and <code>EOP</code> are interchangeable. </li>
<li> The <var>record-name-1</var> specified on the statement must be defined as an 01-level record subordinate to the File Description (<code>FD</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>)) of a file that is currently open for <code>OUTPUT</code> (see <a href="#File-OPEN-Modes">File OPEN Modes</a>), <code>EXTEND</code> or <code>I-O</code>. </li>
<li> The optional  <code>FROM</code> clause will cause <var>literal-1</var> or <var>identifier-1</var> to be automatically moved into <var>record-name-1</var> prior to writing <var>record-name-1</var>’s contents to the appropriate file. If this clause is not specified, it is the programmer’s responsibility to populate <var>record-name-1</var> with the desired data prior to executing the <code>WRITE</code>. </li>
<li> The optional <code>LOCK</code> options may be used to manually control access to the just-written record by other programs while this program is running. See <a href="#Record-Locking">Record Locking</a>, to review the various record locking behaviour. </li>
<li> The optional <code>INVALID KEY</code> and <code>NOT INVALID KEY</code> clauses may be used when writing to relative or indexed files to detect and react to the failure (non-zero file status code) or success (00 file status code), respectively, of the statement. See <a href="#File-Status-Codes">File Status Codes</a>, for additional information. </li>
<li> When <code>WRITE</code> is used against an <code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-LINE-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</a>) file, with or without the <code>LINE ADVANCING</code> (see <a href="#LINE-ADVANCING">LINE ADVANCING</a>) option, an end-of-record delimiter character sequence will be written to the file to signify where one record ends and the next record begins. This delimiter sequence will be either of the following: <ul> <li> A line-terminator sequence consisting of an ASCII carriage-return/line-feed character sequence (<code>X'0D0A'</code>) if you are running a MinGW or native Windows build of GnuCOBOL </li>
<li> A line-terminator sequence consisting of an ASCII line-feed character (<code>X'0A'</code>) if you are running a Cygwin, Linux, Unix or OSX build of GnuCOBOL </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> The following points pertain to the use (or not) of the <code>ADVANCING</code> clause: <ol> <li> Using this clause with any organization other than <code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code> will either be rejected outright by the compiler (relative or indexed files) or may introduce unwanted characters into the file (<code>ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</a>)). </li>
<li> If no <code>ADVANCING</code> clause is specified on a <code>WRITE</code> to a line-advancing file, <code>AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE</code> will be assumed; on other than line-advancing files, <code>BEFORE ADVANCING 1 LINE</code> will be assumed. </li>
<li> When  <code>BEFORE ADVANCING</code> is used (or implied), the record is written to the file before the <code>ADVANCING</code> action writes line-terminator characters to the file. </li>
<li> If  <code>AFTER ADVANCING</code> is used (or implied), the <code>ADVANCING</code> action writes line-terminator characters to the file and then the record data is written to the file. </li>
<li> The <code>ADVANCING n LINES</code> clause will introduce the specified number of line-terminator character sequences into the file either before the written record (<code>AFTER ADVANCING</code>) or after the written record (<code>BEFORE ADVANCING</code>). </li>
<li> If the <code>LINAGE</code> (see <a href="#File_002fSort_002dDescription">File/Sort-Description</a>) clause is <i>absent</i> from the file’s <code>FD</code>: <ol> <li> The  <code>ADVANCING PAGE</code> clause will introduce an ASCII formfeed character into the file either before the written record (<code>AFTER PAGE</code>) or after the written record (<code>BEFORE PAGE</code>). </li>
<li> Management of areas on the printed page such as top-of page headers, bottom-of-page footers, dealing with “full page” situations and the like are the complete responsibility of the programmer. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> If the LINAGE clause is <i>present</i> in the file’s <code>FD</code>: <ol> <li> The <code>ADVANCING PAGE</code> clause will introduce the appropriate number of line-terminator character sequences into the file either before the written record (<code>AFTER ADVANCING</code>) or after the written record (<code>BEFORE ADVANCING</code>) so as to force the printer to automatically advance to a new sheet of paper when the file prints. No formfeed characters will be generated when <code>LINAGE</code> is specified — instead, it is assumed that the printer to which the report will be printed will be loaded with special forms that conform to the specifications defined by the <code>LINAGE</code> clause. </li>
<li> Management of areas on the printed page such as top-of page headers, bottom-of-page footers, dealing with “full page” situations and the like are now the joint responsibility of the programmer and the GnuCOBOL run-time library, which provides tools such as the   <code>LINAGE-COUNTER</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>) and the  <code>END-OF-PAGE</code> clause to deal with page formatting issues. </li>
<li> The <code>AT END-OF-PAGE</code> clause will be triggered, thus executing <var>imperative-statement-1</var> (see <a href="#Imperative-Statement">Imperative Statement</a>), if the <code>WRITE</code> statement introduces a data line or line-feed character into the file at a line position within the Page Footer area defined by the <code>LINAGE</code> clause. The <code>NOT AT END-OF-PAGE</code> clause will be triggered (thus executing <var>imperative-statement-2</var>) if no end-of-page condition occurred during the <code>WRITE</code>. </li>

</ol>     <h2 class="unnumbered" id="Functions">8. Functions</h2>       <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Intrinsic-Functions">8.1. Intrinsic Functions</h2> <p>GnuCOBOL supports a wide variety of “intrinsic functions” that may be used anywhere in the PROCEDURE DIVISION where a literal is allowed. For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">MOVE FUNCTION LENGTH(Employee-Last-Name) TO Employee-LN-Len
</pre>
</div> <p>Note how the word <code>FUNCTION</code> is part of the syntax when you use an intrinsic function. You can use intrinsic functions without having to include the reserved word <code>FUNCTION</code> via settings in the <code>REPOSITORY</code> (see <a href="#REPOSITORY">REPOSITORY</a>) paragraph. You may accomplish the same thing by specifying the   <samp>-fintrinsics</samp> switch to the GnuCOBOL compiler when you compile your programs. </p> <p>User-written functions (see <a href="#Subprogram-Types">Subprogram Types</a>) never require the <code>FUNCTION</code> keyword when they are executed, because each user-written function a program uses <i>must</i> be included in that program’s <code>REPOSITORY</code> paragraph, which therefore makes the <code>FUNCTION</code> keyword optional. </p> <p>The following intrinsic functions, known to other “dialects” of COBOL, are defined to GnuCOBOL as reserved words but are not otherwise implemented currently. Any attempts to use these functions will result in a compile-time error message. However they are described at the end of this chapter. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">BOOLEAN-OF-INTEGER

 ~~~
</pre>  <p>This function determines and returns the absolute value of <var>number</var> (a numeric literal or data item) supplied as an argument. </p> <p>Note that <code>ABSOLUTE-VALUE</code> has an alias for this function. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="ACOS">8.1.2. ACOS</h3> <h4>ACOS Function Syntax </h4> <pre class="verbatim"> ACOS(cosine)
 ~~~~
</pre>  <p>The <code>ACOS</code> function determines and returns the trigonometric arc-cosine, or inverse cosine, of <var>cosine</var> value (a numeric literal or data item) supplied as an argument. </p> <p>The result will be an angle, expressed in radians. You may convert this to an angle measured in degrees, as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">COMPUTE <var>degrees</var> = ( <var>radians</var> * 180 ) / FUNCTION PI

 ~~~~~~~
</pre>  <p>This function returns a numeric value approximating the ratio of an annuity paid at <var>interest-rate</var> (numeric data item or literal) for each of <var>number-of-periods</var> (numeric data items or literals). </p> <p><var>interest-rate</var> is the rate of interest paid at each payment. If you only have an annual interest rate and you wish to compute monthly annuity payments, divide the annual interest rate by 12 and use that value for <var>interest-rate</var>. </p> <p>Multiply the result of this function times the desired principal amount to determine the amount of each period’s payment. </p> <p>A note for the financially challenged: an annuity is basically a reverse loan; an accountant would take the result of this function multiplied by -1 times the principal amount to compute a loan payment you are making. </p>      <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="ASIN">8.1.4. ASIN</h3> <h4>ASIN Function Syntax </h4> <pre class="verbatim"> ASIN(sine)

</pre>  <p><code>BYTE-LENGTH</code> returns the length — in bytes — of <var>string</var> (a group item, <code>USAGE DISPLAY</code> elementary item or alphanumeric literal). This intrinsic function is identical to the <code>LENGTH-AN</code> (see <a href="#LENGTH_002dAN">LENGTH-AN</a>) function. Note that the value returned by this function is not necessarily the number of <i>characters</i> comprising <var>string</var>, but rather the number of actual <i>bytes</i> required to store it. </p> <p>For example, if <var>string</var> is encoded using a double-byte character set such as Unicode UTF-16 (where each character is represented by 16 bits of storage, not the 8-bits inherent to character sets like <small>ASCII</small> or <small>EBCDIC</small>), then calling this function with a <var>string</var> argument whose <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) is <code>X(4)</code> would return a value of 8 rather than the value 4. </p> <p>Contrast this with the <code>LENGTH</code> (see <a href="#LENGTH">LENGTH</a>) function. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="CHAR">8.1.7. CHAR</h3> <h4>CHAR Function Syntax </h4> <pre class="verbatim"> CHAR(integer)
 ~~~~
</pre>  <p>This function returns the character in the ordinal position specified by <var>integer</var> (a numeric integer literal or data item with a value of 1 or greater) from the <code>COLLATING SEQUENCE</code> (see <a href="#OBJECT_002dCOMPUTER">OBJECT-COMPUTER</a>) being used by the program. </p> <p>For example, if the program is using the (default) <small>ASCII</small> character set, CHAR(34) returns the 34th character in the <small>ASCII</small> character set — an exclamation-point (‘<samp>!</samp>’). If you are using this function to convert a numeric value to its corresponding <small>ASCII</small> character, you must use an argument value one greater than the numeric value. </p> <p>If an argument whose value is less than 1 or greater than 256 is specified, the character in the program collating sequence corresponding to a value of all zero bits is returned. </p> <p>The following code is an alternative approach when you just wish to convert a number to its <small>ASCII</small> equivalent: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  Char-Value.

</ul> <p>Early versions of Micro Focus COBOL allowed programmers to access various runtime library routines by using a single two-digit hexadecimal number as the entry-point name. These were known as call-by-number routines. Over time, Micro Focus COBOL evolved, replacing most of the call-by-number routines with ones accessible using a more conventional call-by-name technique. </p> <p>Most of the call-by-number routines have evolved into even more powerful call-by-name routines, many of which are supported by GnuCOBOL. </p> <p>Some of the original call-by-number routines never evolved call-by-name equivalents; GnuCOBOL supports some of these routines. </p> <p>The following sections describe the various built-in subroutines. <i>All subroutine arguments are mandatory except where explicitly noted to the contrary</i>. Any subroutine returning a value to the   <code>RETURN-CODE</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>) could utilize the <code>RETURNING</code> clause on the <code>CALL</code> statement to return the result back to the full-word binary data item of your choice. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="C_0024CALLEDBY">8.2.1.

How RWCS Builds Report Pages</h2> <p>A report created via a <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>) will contain carriage-control information. Most notably, <small>ASCII</small> form-feed characters (X’0C’) will be written to the report file to support the statement’s <code>ADVANCING PAGE</code> option. Whether the data for a report line created via <code>ADVANCING PAGE</code> occurs <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> the form-feed character depends upon whether the programmer coded <code>WRITE <var>record-name</var> BEFORE ADVANCING PAGE</code> or <code>WRITE <var>record-name</var> AFTER ADVANCING PAGE</code>, respectively. </p> <p>The GnuCOBOL implementation of RWCS does not issue any carriage-control information to the report files it produces — instead, it relies upon the information coded in the <code>RD</code> for the report (specifically the <code>PAGE LIMITS</code> and related options) and its internally-generated and managed   <code>LINE-COUNTER</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>) for the report to know when to issue any blank lines to the file to fill-out the end of a printed page. </p> <p>Because this is the way the GnuCOBOL RWCS works, in order to design an RWCS-generated report you’ll need to know answers to the following questions: </p>
<ol> <li> What printer(s) will the report be printed on? </li>
<li> What paper orientation will you use, — Landscape (long edge of the paper at the top and bottom of page), or Portrait (long edge of the paper at the left and right of page)? </li>
<li> What tool will be used to print the report (direct printing to the device, notepad.exe, MS-Word, …)? </li>
<li> What font and font size will be used for the report when it is printed? RWCS-generated reports will assume that a fixed-width font such as “Courier”, “Lucida Console”, “Consolas” and the like will be used to print, as variable-pitch fonts would make the proper alignment of columns of data on reports virtually impossible. </li>
<li> When unprintable area exists at all four margins of the paper? These are generally caused by the printer itself or by its software driver. </li>
<li> What is the maximum number of lines per page that may be printed on a single sheet of paper? </li>
<li> What is the maximum number of characters that may be printed on one line? </li>
</ol> <p> Once you know the answer to questions 1-4, you may easily determine the answers to the remaining questions as follows: </p>
<ol> <li> Prepare a text file containing 100 or so records, each consisting of a numeric scale (<code>123456789012345678901234</code>…). </li>
<li> Print the file in a manner consistent with your answers to questions 1-4. </li>
<li> Add any necessary additional digits to each record in your test file (if lines weren’t full) or remove characters from the end of each record if lines wrapped. If you made changes, reprint the file. </li>
<li> Now that you know <i>exactly</i> how long each record may be, add additional records and reprint. Continue until printing overflows to a second page. </li>
<li> The first page you print is now a perfect template to use when designing reports — it shows, given the answers to questions 1-4, every available printable character position on a page! The number of lines printed on that page becomes your <code>PAGE LIMIT</code> value for the <code>RD</code>. </li>
</ol> <p> The remaining <code>PAGE LIMIT</code> values can be established as required by your report(s). </p> <p>Using <var>identifier</var> rather than <var>integer</var> specifications in the <code>RD</code> will give your program the ability — at run time — to accommodate multiple printers, fonts, font sizes and paper orientation. Just follow the above steps for each combination you wish your program to support. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Control-Hierarchy">9.5. Control Hierarchy</h2> <p>Every report that employs control breaks has a natural hierarchy of those control breaks based upon the manner in which the data the report is being generated from is sorted. This concept is best understood using an example which assumes a COBOL program to process sales data collected from every computerized cash register across a chain of stores having multiple departments is being developed. </p> <p>The application that collects data from the various cash registers at each store will generate data records that look like this to a COBOL program: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  Sales-For-Register.
    05 Sales-Date            PIC 9(8).
    05 Time-Collected        PIC 9(6).
    05 Register-Number       PIC 9(7).
    05 Store-Number          PIC 9(3).
    05 Department-Number     PIC 9(3).
    05 Total-Sales           PIC 9(6)V99.
</pre>
</div> <p> Your task is to develop a report that shows the sales total from each cash register and summarizes those sales by department within each store, by store and also generates a total sales figure for the day across all stores. </p> <p>To accomplish this, you will use a <code>SORT</code> statement (see <a href="#SORT">SORT</a>) to sort the file of cash register sales data into: </p>
<ol> <li> Ascending sequence of store number </li>
<li> Within each store, data will be sorted into ascending sequence of department number </li>
<li> If there are multiple cash registers in a particular department of a specific store, the data needs to be further sorted so that the cash registers are ordered in sequence of their register number. </li>
</ol> <p>So, assuming a sort file has been defined and its record layout (essentially a mirror of the raw data file) is defined as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  Sorted-Sales-For-Register.
    05 Sorted-Sales-Date            PIC 9(8).
    05 Sorted-Time-Collected        PIC 9(6).
    05 Sorted-Register-Number       PIC 9(7).
    05 Sorted-Store-Number          PIC 9(3).
    05 Sorted-Department-Number     PIC 9(3).
    05 Sorted-Total-Sales           PIC 9(6)V99.
</pre>
</div> <p> Then the <code>SORT</code> statement to accomplish the desired sequencing would be: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">SORT SORT-FILE
    ASCENDING KEY Sorted-Store-Number
                  Sorted-Department-Number
                  Sorted-Register-Number
    USING Input-file
    OUTPUT PROCEDURE 100-Generate-Report
</pre>
</div> <p> As a result of the sort, our program might expect to see data somewhat like this (date, time and sales totals are shown as “…”): </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">   +-------------------- Register Number
   |      +------------- Store Number
   |      |  +---------- Department Number
   |      |  |
...0535240001001...
...0589130001001...
...0625174001001...
...0122234001002...
...0732345001002...
...0003423001003...
...2038774001004...
...0112646002001...

...3245677002003...
...4456778002003...
...0002345002004...
</pre>
</div> <p> Because of the sort, the most-frequently changing value of the three sort keys will be that of <code>Sorted-Register-Number</code>. This essentially defines the “detail” level of the report. </p> <p>The next most-frequently changing value is that of <code>Sorted-Department-Number</code>, and the least-frequently changing value is that of <code>Sorted-Store-Number</code>. remember that the program should be generating totals each time one of these two values change, plus a grand total of sales at the end of the report. These three points are the  <em>Control Break</em> points of the report. </p> <p>When the report is defined, it’s <code>RD</code> would contain a <code>CONTROLS ARE</code> clause that lists the control breaks in least- to most-frequent sequence of changing. This would be coded as: </p> <p><code>CONTROLS ARE FINAL, Sorted-Store-Number, Sorted-Department-Number</code> </p> <p>A <code>FINAL</code> control break only occurs once, at the very end of the report. The <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code> for this break will be the one that produces the grand total of sales for all stores. </p> <p>The next break listed on the <code>CONTROLS</code> clause will be the one that occurs next most-frequently (<code>Sorted-Store-Number</code>). This control break will be the one that produces the summation for each entire store, and will have its own <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code>. </p> <p>The next (and last, in this case) break listed on the <code>CONTROLS</code> clause will be the one that occurs even more frequently (<code>Sorted-Department-Number</code>). The <code>CONTROL FOOTING</code> for this control field will be the one that summarizes sales for each department within a store. </p> <p>This sequence of control breaks from least- to most-frequent (in other words, in the order they occur on the <code>CONTROLS ARE</code> clause) is the ’<i>control hierarchy</i>’ of the report; control breaks that occur more frequently than others are said to be at a lower level in the control hierarchy. </p> <p>Defining a control hierarchy (via <code>CONTROLS ARE</code>) that does not match the actual sequence in which data will be processed is a great way to guarantee a “broken” report. I’ll show you an example in a later section. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="An-Example">9.6. An Example</h2> <p>This section contains an example of the RWCS at work.

The data for the report was obtained from the website <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/www.cpubenchmark.net">www.cpubenchmark.net</a> in December of 2013. By the time you are reading this, that data will most likely have become rather out of date, but it illustrates RWCS well enough. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Data">9.6.1. Data</h3> <p>Here is the data that the program will be reading. Each record reflects the aggregated benchmark scoring for one particular CPU, as scores for benchmarks against that CPU have been reported to the <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/cpubenchmark.net">cpubenchmark.net</a> website by their PassMark benchmark software. The data consists of four fields. Fields are separated from one another by a single comma. The descriptions of the fields are as follows: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><b>Benchmark Score</b></dt> <dd>
<p>A five-digit number showing the aggregated benchmark scores for the CPU; the higher this number, the better the CPU performed in benchmark testing. </p> </dd> <dt><b>Vendor</b></dt> <dd>
<p>The name of the vendor who makes the CPU. In this data, that will either be “AMD” (American Micro Devices) or “INTEL”. </p> </dd> <dt><b>Family</b></dt> <dd>
<p>The 7-character family of CPU products the CPU falls into. This will have values such as “A4”, “A10”, “Core i5”, “Core i7”, etc. </p> </dd> <dt><b>Model</b></dt> <dd><p>The specific model of CPU within the family. </p></dd> </dl> <p> The first record of data shown below shows that the aggregated score of all benchmarks reported for the AMD A10-4600M CPU is 3145, as compared to the second record which shows that the aggregated score reported of all benchmarks reported for the Intel Core-i7-4960X CPU is 14291. </p> <p>The following is the complete set of input data used for this example. This is by no means the complete set of data available at <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/cpubenchmark.net">cpubenchmark.net</a> — it is just a representative sample used for this example. For my class, I give my students a report showing the results for almost a thousand CPUs. </p> <p>For the sake of brevity, this document lists the data in three columns. </p> <div class="smallformat"> <pre class="verbatim">03145,AMD,A10,4600M            05421,AMD,FX,6100              03917,Intel,Core i5,4300U

</div> <p> RWCS will still be counting lines to decide when to close off one page and start a new one, but when a new page is started its page heading will <i>physically</i> form-feed the printer when the report is printed. As long as any printer you plan on using supports at least as many physical print lines as what is defined as the <code>PAGE LIMIT</code> value in whatever paper orientation and font you plan on (or are limited to) printing in, you have now divorced your program from the physical realities of the printer! </p> <p>Of course, whatever software you are using to deliver the printed document to the printer with, must allow the <small>ASCII</small> form-feed character to pass through to the printer. </p>    <h2 class="unnumbered" id="Interfacing-With-The-OS">10.

</pre> <p>Each file specified on the <code>cobc</code> command constitutes a  <em>Compilation Unit</em>. A compilation unit may be a single GnuCOBOL program — with or without nested subprograms(see <a href="#Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">Independent vs Contained vs Nested Subprograms</a>) — or multiple GnuCOBOL programs, separated by <code>END PROGRAM</code> or <code>END FUNCTION</code> marker lines, as appropriate. See <a href="#Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">Independent vs Contained vs Nested Subprograms</a>, for some examples of these marker lines. </p> <p>A compilation unit may also be a C-language source program, recognized as such by having a file extension of <code>.c</code> or an assembly-language program, recognized by its file extension of <samp>.s</samp>. In such a case, <i>COBOL</i> compilation of that file will be bypassed by the <code>cobc</code> command; instead, the file will be passed directly to the C compiler or assembler (executed automatically by <code>cobc</code>). </p> <p>A compilation unit may <i>also</i> be an object-code module (output from the C compiler), recognized as such by having a file extension of <code>.o</code>. In these situations, all compilation will be bypassed, and the object code will be “bound” into the generated executable by the linker (an <code>ld</code> command executed internally by the <code>cobc</code> command). </p> <p>Pre-compiled object-code subprograms may be automatically located by the GnuCOBOL compiler and the loader by using the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> compilation-time environment variable   (see <a href="#Compilation-Time-Environment-Variables">Compilation Time Environment Variables</a>). If they are locatable through that environment variable, they need not be named on the <code>cobc</code> command. </p> <p>The collection of compilation units supplied on a <i>single</i> <code>cobc</code> execution constitute a  <em>Compilation Group</em>. All executable code produced from a single compilation group will be collected together into a single executable file, whose filename will be the same as that of the first compilation unit specified on the <code>cobc</code> command. </p> <p>The simplest mode of compilation is to generate a single executable file from one or more GnuCOBOL source files: </p> <div>
<code>cobc -x mainprog.cbl sub1.cbl sub2.cbl</code> </div> <p>The main program must be the first program found in the first compilation unit (<samp>mainprog.cbl</samp>). The remainder of that compilation unit as well as the rest of the files in the compilation group (<samp>sub1.cbl</samp> and <samp>sub2.cbl</samp>) must be independent and/or contained subprograms (see <a href="#Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">Independent vs Contained vs Nested Subprograms</a>). </p> <p>This command assumes that all source files are in the directory from which the <code>cobc</code> command was executed. You are, of course, free to include full pathnames with any filename, if necessary. </p> <p>With the   <samp>-x</samp> switch on the compiler command, a single directly-executable executable file (UNIX, Windows/Cygwin, OSX) or “exe” file (Windows, Windows/MinGW) will be generated. This executable file has the compiled code for all COBOL programs contained within the compilation group specified on the <code>cobc</code> command included in the file. </p> <p>Any subroutines or user-defined functions that weren’t included in any of the source files comprising the compilation group will be treated as dynamically loadable subprograms (see <a href="#Dynamic-vs-Static-Subprograms">Dynamic vs Static Subprograms</a>). </p> <p>Optionally, the   <samp>-o</samp> switch may be used in addition to <code>-x</code> to specify the name of the generated executable file. If <samp>-o</samp> switch is not specified, the filename of the 1st compilation unit will be used as the name of the executable file. The appropriate extension for the generated file (<samp>.exe</samp>, on a Windows computer, for example) will be added to the filename that is explicitly specified or implicitly assumed for the output file. </p> <p>Compilations may be performed to generate dynamically-loadable modules (or dynamically-loadable libraries, as they are frequently called). These compilations are performed by using the   <samp>-m</samp> switch instead of <samp>-x</samp> switch: </p> <div>
<code>cobc -m mainprog.cbl sub1.cbl sub2.cbl</code> </div> <p>When the <samp>-m</samp> switch is used, an operating-system-specific dynamically-loadable module is generated <i>for each individual compilation unit</i>, using the filename of each compilation unit as its module filename and either an extension of <samp>.so</samp> (UNIX, Windows/Cygwin), <samp>.dylib</samp> (OSX) or <samp>.dll</samp> (Windows, Windows/MinGW). </p> <p>You may compile GnuCOBOL subprograms into assembler source code which can then be assembled and linked with a main program when that main program is compiled. To create such an assembler source file, compile the subprogram(s) as follows: </p> <div>
<code>cobc -S sprog1.cbl</code> </div> <p>The above generates an assembler source file named <samp>sprog1.s</samp>. If you have multiple subprograms to compile this way, just string their file names out on the command. Each will be translated to its own assembler source file. </p> <p>Later, when you wish to compile a calling program and combine any needed assembly language subroutines in (as static subroutines — see <a href="#Dynamic-vs-Static-Subprograms">Dynamic vs Static Subprograms</a>), use a command such as this: </p> <div>
<code>cobc -x mainprog.cbl sprog1.s</code> </div>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="cobc-option-_002dXref-an-example">10.1.1.1. cobc option -Xref an example</h3> <p>The following shows the output from using -Xref. </p>

Locating Copybooks</h3> <p>The GnuCOBOL compiler will attempt to locate copybooks by searching for them in the following folders.

<ol> <li> The folder named as the <var>library-name-1</var> on the <code>COPY</code> statement (see <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>). </li>
<li> The folder in which the program being compiled resides. </li>
<li> The folder named on the   <samp>-I</samp> switch. </li>
<li> Each of the folders named on the <code>COBCPY</code> compilation-time environment variable   (see <a href="#Compilation-Time-Environment-Variables">Compilation Time Environment Variables</a>). <p>A single folder may be named or multiple folders may be specified, separated by a system-appropriate delimiter character. When multiple folders are specified, they will be searched in the order they are named on the environment variable. </p> <p>If the GnuCOBOL compiler you are using was built to utilize a native Windows environment, use a semicolon (‘<samp>;</samp>’) as the delimiter character. </p> <p>If, however, the GnuCOBOL compiler was built for a Unix, OSX or Linux environment, or was built for a Windows environment utilizing either the Cygwin or MinGW Unix emulators, use a colon character (‘<samp>:</samp>’) as the delimiter. </p> </li>
<li> The <i>single</i> folder specified on the COB_COPY_DIR environment variable. </li>
</ol> <p>As each of the above folders is searched for a copybook — <code>COPY <var>XXXXXXXX</var>.</code>, for example — the GnuCOBOL compiler will attempt to locate the copybook file by any of the following names, in the sequence shown: </p>
<ul class="no-bullet"> <li> <code><var>XXXXXXXX</var>.CPY</code> </li>
<li> <code><var>XXXXXXXX</var>.CBL</code> </li>

<li> <code><var>XXXXXXXX</var>.cob</code> </li>
<li> <code><var>XXXXXXXX</var></code> </li>
</ul> <p>The <code>COPY</code> statement is case-sensitive on UNIX systems; <code>COPY copybookname</code> and <code>COPY COPYBOOKNAME</code> will both fail to locate the <code>CopyBookName</code> copybook on a UNIX system. </p> <p>Windows implementations of GnuCOBOL may, or may not, be similarly case sensitive with regard to copybook names, depending upon the Windows version and GnuCOBOL build options — it is safest to simply treat the COPY command as case-sensitive in all environments. </p> <p>It is possible, however, to automatically cause all <code>COPY</code> statements to “fold” the names of all copybooks to upper-case by specifying the   <samp>-ffold-copy</samp> switch with the <code>upper</code> option (i.e. <code>--fold-copy=upper</code>) to the GnuCOBOL compiler. Similarly, names could be folded to lower-case by using the <code>lower</code> option (i.e. <code>--fold-copy=lower</code>. If copybook libraries are maintained entirely using upper- or lower-case file names and extensions, either of these options will allow copybooks to be found regardless of how the programmer entered their names on <code>COPY</code> statements. </p> <p>Case-folding may also be turned on and off within the program source code using the CDF <code>&gt;&gt;SET</code> statement (see <a href="#g_t_003e_003eSET">&gt;&gt;SET</a>). </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Compiler-Configuration-Files">10.1.5.

</pre>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Running-Programs">10.2. Running Programs</h2> <p>Once GnuCOBOL programs have been compiled into either directly-executable programs (created via the <samp>-x</samp> switch) or dynamically-loadable libraries (created via the <samp>-m</samp> switch), those programs may be executed from any shell environment. The exact manner in which the two are executed will differ, as described in the upcoming sections. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Direct-Execution">10.2.1. Direct Execution</h3> <p>GnuCOBOL programs compiled with the   <samp>-x</samp> switch will be generated as directly-executable programs. For example, a native Windows or Windows/MinGW build of GnuCOBOL will generate an <samp>.exe</samp> file when the <samp>-x</samp> switch switch is specified to the compiler. </p> <p>On Unix, OSX, or Windows/Cygwin builds, the <samp>-x</samp> switch switch will generate an executable binary file, usually with no particular extension unless one is explicitly requested of the compiler via the   <samp>-o</samp> switch. </p> <p>On a UNIX system this means the programs may be executed from a command shell such as bash, csh, ksh and so forth. When a GnuCOBOL program runs on a Windows system, it runs within a console window (i.e. <samp>cmd.exe</samp>). OSX versions of GnuCOBOL programs run within a <samp>terminal.app</samp> window. </p> <p>Interactions between the program and the user will take place using the standard input, standard output and standard error streams. Any screen section I/O performed by the program will take place within the terminal window. </p> <p>Direct program execution syntax is <code>[<var>path</var>]<var>program</var> [<var>arguments</var>]</code>. </p> <p>For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">/usr/local/printaccount ACCT=6625378

Executing Dynamically-Loadable Libraries</h3> <p>As discussed previously, dynamically-loadable libraries are created via the compiler’s <samp>-m</samp> switch. Once so created, the program(s) in these libraries are executed from the command line (via the GnuCOBOL <code>cobcrun</code> utility), or as dynamically-loadable subprograms. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="cobcrun-_002d-Command_002dline-Execution">10.2.2.1. cobcrun - Command-line Execution</h3> <p>It is possible to generate executable modules for all GnuCOBOL programs, not just subprograms, by choosing to use the   <samp>-m</samp> switch option to specify the loader output format, even for main programs. </p> <p>Some may prefer to compile their GnuCOBOL main programs into these dynamically-loadable modules in the interests of using the same general compilation command for all programs without having to think “Is it a main program or a subprogram?”. </p> <p>Main programs compiled in this manner should be executed as follows: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">[<i>path</i>]cobcrun <i>program</i> [<i>arguments</i>]

<p> Here are two examples of using <code>cobcrun</code>. First, on a Unix, OSX or Windows/Cygwin system: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cd /usr/local
cobcrun printaccount acct=6625378

</div> <p> Or, on a Native Windows or Windows/MinGW system: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cd C:\Users\Me\Documents\Programs
cobcrun printaccount.exe acct=6625378
</pre>
</div> <p> Note how the <code>cobcrun</code> command does not allow a path to be specified with the program name — the directory in which the programs dynamically loadable module exists must either be the current directory or must be defined in the current <code>PATH</code>. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="Dynamically-Loaded-Subprograms">10.2.2.2. Dynamically Loaded Subprograms</h3> <p>Dynamically-loaded subprograms are executed (from a COBOL syntax point of view) just like any other subprograms. What makes them unique, however, is that they are loaded into memory only when they are actually used the first time during the execution of a program. </p> <p>When a dynamically-loadable module needs to be loaded (because it is not already in memory from a previous subprogram execution), the dynamically-loadable library will be sought in the same directory from which the main program was loaded. If it cannot be found there, each directory named in the   <code>PATH</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) will be searched. If it was not located in any of those directories, the library specified by the   <code>COB_LIBRARY_PATH</code> run-time environment variable will be searched. Finally, if it <i>still</i> cannot be located, execution will be terminated with an error message (<i>libcob: Cannot find module ’xxxxxxxx’</i>). </p> <p>The process of locating dynamically-loadable modules is case-sensitive on UNIX systems; <code>CALL "dynsub"</code> and <code>CALL "DYNSUB"</code> will both fail to locate the <code>DynSub.so</code> library on a UNIX system. </p> <p>Windows implementations of GnuCOBOL may, or may not, be similarly case sensitive with regard to library names, depending upon the Windows version and GnuCOBOL build options — it is safest to simply treat library names as case-sensitive in all environments. </p> <p>It is possible, however, to automatically cause all library names to ’fold’ to upper-case by specifying the   <samp>-ffold-call</samp> switch with the “upper” option (i.e. <code>--fold-call=upper</code>) to the GnuCOBOL compiler. Similarly, library names could be folded to lower-case by using the “lower” option (i.e. <code>--fold-call=lower</code>. If libraries are maintained entirely using upper- or lower-case file names, either of these options will allow libraries to be found regardless of how the programmer entered their names on <code>CALL</code> statements. </p> <p>See <a href="#Sub_002dProgramming">Sub-Programming</a>, for a complete discussion of sub-programming. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="Run-Time-Environment-Variables">10.2.3. Run Time Environment Variables</h3>   <p>The following is a list of the various environment variables that can play a role in the execution of GnuCOBOL programs. </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>COB_DISPLAY_WARNINGS</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to a value of ‘<samp>Y</samp>’, any run-time warnings (such as noting the implicit closing of open files when a <code>GOBACK</code> statement (see <a href="#GOBACK">GOBACK</a>) or <code>STOP</code> statement (see <a href="#STOP">STOP</a>) with the <code>RUN</code> option is executed) will be displayed. Any other value for this environment variable (including not setting the variable at all) will suppress such messages. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_LIBRARY_PATH</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>At runtime, GnuCOBOL will attempt to locate and load any application dynamically-loadable libraries using from the directory in which the program executable was found or, if it wasn’t found there, using the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. If these library files could be somewhere else, specify the directory path using this variable. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_LOAD_CASE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to either <code>UPPER</code> or <code>LOWER</code>, this environment variable will internally convert referenced entry-point names to either upper- or lower-case before initiating searches for dynamically-loadable modules. The <code>UPPER</code> and <code>LOWER</code> values of the environment variable are actually case-insensitive. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_PHYSICAL_CANCEL</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to ‘<samp>Y</samp>’, ‘<samp>y</samp>’ or ‘<samp>1</samp>’, a <code>CANCEL</code> statement (see <a href="#CANCEL">CANCEL</a>) will physically unload a subprogram dynamically-loadable module. If set to anything else, a <code>CANCEL</code> statement (see <a href="#CANCEL">CANCEL</a>) logically unloads a module so that subsequent use will re-initialize the module as if it had actually been reloaded, but the overhead of actually reloading the module will be avoided. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_PRE_LOAD</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to any non-null value, this variable will cause all dynamically-loadable libraries to be loaded when the program begins execution (rather than searching for and loading the module upon first use). </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SET_DEBUG</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If a <code>USE FOR DEBUGGING</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) section exists, the code within it will be disabled unless this environment variable is set to a value of ‘<samp>Y</samp>’, ‘<samp>y</samp>’ or ‘<samp>1</samp>’. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SET_TRACE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If the   <samp>-ftrace</samp> switch (trace procedures) or   <samp>-ftraceall</samp> switch (trace procedures and statements) was used when the program was compiled, setting this environment variable to a value of ‘<samp>Y</samp>’ will activate the trace at the point the program begins execution. Setting this environment variable to any other value (or never setting it to ANY value) will disable tracing. Tracing, if configured by one of the two switches described above, can also be controlled via the the <code>READY TRACE</code> statement (see <a href="#READY-TRACE">READY TRACE</a>) and <code>RESET TRACE</code> statement (see <a href="#RESET-TRACE">RESET TRACE</a>). If COB_SET_TRACE is set to Y, then tracing will always occur regardless of the presence of READY TRACE or RESET TRACE so in effect they will have no action on program execution. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SCREEN_ESC</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to any non-blank value, this variable allows a <code>ACCEPT screen-data-item</code> statement (see <a href="#ACCEPT-screen_002ddata_002ditem">ACCEPT screen-data-item</a>) to detect the <code>Esc</code> key. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SCREEN_EXCEPTIONS</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>Setting this variable to any non-blank value will allow the <code>ACCEPT screen-data-item</code> statement (see <a href="#ACCEPT-screen_002ddata_002ditem">ACCEPT screen-data-item</a>) to detect the pressing of the <code>Esc</code>, <code>PgUp</code> and <code>PgDn</code> keys. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SORT_MEMORY</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>The value of this variable (an integer) will be used to define how much memory will be allocated for use in sorting. If the value is 1048576 or greater, that value will be used “as is” as the amount of memory (in bytes) to allocate. If the value is less than 1048576, the value will specify how many MB of memory will be allocated. The default sort memory amount is 128 MB. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SWITCH_n</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>(n=0 to 15); These environment variables correspond to <code>SWITCH-0</code> through <code>SWITCH-15</code>, defined in the <code>SPECIAL-NAMES</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) paragraph. Setting them to <code>ON</code> will activate them; any other value turns them off. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_SYNC</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to a value of upper- or lower-case ‘<samp>p</samp>’, this variable will force a file commit every time a file is written to (ensuring that data is immediately written to the file rather than retained in memory until a future commit occurs). This will slow-down update access to files, but will provide for better integrity in the event of a program failure. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>COB_TRACE_FILE</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If set to any non-null value, this environment variable specifies the file to which all <samp>-ftrace</samp> switch and <samp>-ftraceall</samp> switch output will be written. If this is NOT set to a value, all <samp>-ftrace</samp> switch and <samp>-ftraceall</samp> switch output will be written to STDERR, where it may be piped via a "2&gt; filename" on the command that executes the program. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>DB_HOME</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>If your GnuCOBOL build uses the Berkeley Database (BDB) package, use this environment variable to specify the folder in which the lock management files to be associated with all non-SORT files opened by the program will be stored. <code>ORGANIZATION INDEXED</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-INDEXED">ORGANIZATION INDEXED</a>) files will also have their data file allocated in the folder pointed to by this environment variable, if it exists.. Having this variable defined will activate record locking features on the <code>READ</code> statement (see <a href="#READ">READ</a>), <code>REWRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#REWRITE">REWRITE</a>) and <code>WRITE</code> statement (see <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a>). Even with DB_HOME, locking will not work with <code>ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL</a>), <code>ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</code> (see <a href="#ORGANIZATION-LINE-SEQUENTIAL">ORGANIZATION LINE SEQUENTIAL</a>) or ORGANIZATION RELATIVE files with GnuCOBOL builds created for Windows/MinGW. <code>ORGANIZATION INDEXED</code> locks will work with Windows/MinGW + BDB and all locks will work for all file organizations with UNIX GnuCOBOL builds. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>PATH</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>The GnuCOBOL "bin" directory should be defined in the PATH. </p>
</dd> <dt><code>TMPDIR</code></dt>  <dt><code>TMP</code></dt>  <dt><code>TEMP</code></dt> <dd>
 <p>One of these environment variables must be set to a directory/folder appropriate to create temporary files in. They will be checked in the order shown. This will be used by the <code>SORT</code> statement (see <a href="#SORT">SORT</a>) and <code>MERGE</code> statement (see <a href="#MERGE">MERGE</a>) to create temporary work files. You may also use this folder for any temporary files your application may require. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>Also used during execution of programs is runtime.cfg also found in <code>/usr/local/share/gnucobol/config</code> for *nix and this file can also be changed to match your environment if needed. When viewing, note the Default settings. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="General-instructions">10.2.3.1. General instructions</h3> <pre class="verbatim"> The initial runtime.cfg file is found in the  $COB_CONFIG_DIR/config
 (  COB_CONFIG_DIR  defaults to  installdir/gnucobol  ).
 The environment variable  COB_RUNTIME_CONFIG  may define a different runtime
 configuration file to read.

 If settings are included in the runtime environment file multiple times
 then the last setting value is used, no warning occurs.

 Settings via environment variables always take precedence over settings
 that are given in runtime configuration files. And the environment is
 checked after completing processing of the runtime configuration file(s)

 All values set to string variables or environment variables are checked
 for  ${envvar}  and replacement is done at the time of the setting.

 Any environment variable may be set with the directive  setenv  .
 Example:  setenv COB_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

 Any environment variable may be unset with the directive  unsetenv
 (one var per line).
 Example:  unsetenv COB_LIBRARY_PATH

 Runtime configuration files can include other files with the directive
 include.
 Example:  include my-runtime-configuration-file

 To include another configuration file only if it is present use the directive
 includeif.
 You can also use  ${envvar}  inside this.
 Example:  includeif ${HOME}/mygc.cfg

 If you want to reset a parameter to its default value use:
    reset parametername

 Most runtime variables have boolean values, some are switches, some have
 string values, integer values and some are size values.
 The boolean values will be evaluated as following:
       to true:          1, Y, ON, YES, TRUE  (no matter of case)
       to false:         0, N, OFF
 A 'size' value is an integer optionally followed by K, M, or G for kilo, mega
 or giga.

 For convenience a parameter in the runtime.cfg file may be defined by using
 either the environment variable name or the parameter name.
 In most cases the environment variable name is the parameter name (in upper
 case) with the prefix  COB_  .

 Note: If you want to *slightly* speed up a program's startup time, remove all
       of the comments from the actual real configuration file that is processed

Sub-Programming</h2>       <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Subprogram-Types">11.1. Subprogram Types</h2> <p>Simply stated, a  <em>Subprogram</em> is a program that is invoked by another program; the subprogram performs whatever its designed operations are and — when complete — typically returns control back to the program that invoked it. There are two different types of subprograms supported by GnuCOBOL, subroutines and user-defined functions. The distinction between these two subprogram types lies in the manner in which they are executed. </p> <p>When program <i>A</i> invokes subprogram <i>B</i> as a  <em>Subroutine</em>, it does so using a special statement dedicated to that function (the <code>CALL</code> statement (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>), just as if <i>B</i> were one of the built-in system subroutines. </p> <p>When program <i>A</i> invokes program <i>B</i> as a  <em>User-Defined Function</em>, it does so in a manner identical to how <i>B</i> would have been invoked had it been one of the many built-in intrinsic functions. </p> <p>In either instance, program <i>A</i> is referred to as the  <em>Calling Program</em> while program <i>B</i> is known as the  <em>Called Program</em>. GnuCOBOL programs may be a calling program, a called program or both. </p> <p>A program written in the C programming language may serve as either the calling or called program too. A called program may act as a calling program to another called program. When a calling program does not serve as a called program to any program, that calling program is known as a  <em>Main Program</em>. </p> <p>Both subroutines and user-defined functions may return a value. The value they return must be an integer in the range -2147483648 to +2147483647. This value will be available in the   <code>RETURN-CODE</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>) and also as the value of the data item specified on the <code>RETURNING</code> (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>) clause of a subroutine’s <code>CALL</code>. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Independent-vs-Contained-vs-Nested-Subprograms">11.2.

 <p>It is also possible to create source files where GnuCOBOL programs are nested inside each other. Take for example these four GnuCOBOL programs: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.

</div> <p>Here we see that <code>PROG2</code> is nested inside of <code>PROG1</code> because there is no <code>END PROGRAM</code> marker separating them. This means that data items or files defined within <code>PROG1</code> can be used within <code>PROG2</code> simply by attaching the <code>GLOBAL</code> (see <a href="#GLOBAL">GLOBAL</a>) attribute to them back in <code>PROG1</code> when they are defined. </p> <p>Similarly, since there is no <code>END PROGRAM</code> marker separating <code>PROG3</code> from <code>PROG2</code>, it is possible for <code>PROG3</code> to access <code>GLOBAL</code> files and data items defined within <code>PROG2</code>. Since <code>PROG2</code> is nested within <code>PROG1</code>, any <code>GLOBAL</code> resources defined within <code>PROG1</code> will be available to <code>PROG3</code> as well. </p> <p>The two <code>END PROGRAM</code> markers for <code>PROG3</code> and <code>PROG2</code> (note their sequence) mean that PROG4 is nested within <code>PROG1</code> only. It will not have access to any <code>GLOBAL</code> resources defined within either <code>PROG2</code> or <code>PROG3</code>. </p> <p>The <code>END PROGRAM PROG1.</code> marker, since it is the last line in the source file, is entirely optional. </p>
</dd> </dl>      <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Alternate-Entry-Points">11.3. Alternate Entry Points</h2> <p>Any subroutine may have multiple entry-points defined within it. This means the subroutine could be called either via a <code>CALL '<var>program-id</var>'</code> or a <code>CALL '<var>entry-point</var>'</code> statement. There may be any number of alternate entry-points defined within a subroutine. </p> <p>Alternate entry-points provide multiple ways in which the same subroutine may be called; presumably, each entry-point will provide some different functionality to the calling program. For example, if you wished to write a subroutine that manipulates "student" records in a database, you might have the primary entry-point name retrieve a student record from the database, while the alternate entry points <code>Add-Student</code>, <code>Update-Student</code> and <code>Delete-Student</code> could provide the alternate functions implied by their entry-point names. </p> <p>The alternative to using multiple entry points in your subroutine, by the way, would be to include an additional argument to the primary (and only) entry point of the subroutine; this new argument might be named <code>STUDENT-FUNCTION</code> and might have values of ‘<samp>FETCH</samp>’, ‘<samp>ADD</samp>’, ‘<samp>UPDATE</samp>’ or ‘<samp>DELETE</samp>’. </p> <p>The primary entry-point for any subroutine is always the first executable statement following any <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) in the procedure division. The name of that entry-point (the name that will be called) is the subroutine’s <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> (see <a href="#IDENTIFICATION-DIVISION">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</a>). </p> <p>An alternate entry point is added to a subroutine using the <code>ENTRY</code> statement (see <a href="#ENTRY">ENTRY</a>). </p> <p>When an alternate entry-point is called, execution within the subroutine will begin at the first executable statement following the <code>ENTRY</code> statement. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Dynamic-vs-Static-Subprograms">11.4. Dynamic vs Static Subprograms</h2> <p>Any subprogram may be either statically or dynamically loaded into memory. </p> <p>A  <em>Static Subprogram</em> is one which was in the same Compilation Unit (see <a href="#Compilation-Unit">Compilation Unit</a>) as the other program(s) which call it, therefore meaning that its executable object code is part of the same executable file as its calling program. The static subprogram was therefore loaded into memory as part of and at the same time as the calling program. </p> <p>A  <em>Dynamic Subprogram</em> is one whose executable object code exists as an executable file separate from that containing the calling program; these two programs were therefore each compiled in their own separate Compilation Group (see <a href="#Compilation-Group">Compilation Group</a>). Dynamic subprograms are located and loaded into memory the first time they are executed. Dynamic subprograms may be unloaded from memory via the <code>CANCEL</code> statement (see <a href="#CANCEL">CANCEL</a>), if desired. </p> <p>GnuCOBOL subprograms may be created as either static or dynamic subprograms, as desired by the programmer. </p> <p>To demonstrate, assume that a GnuCOBOL Main Program (whose code resides in the file <samp>M.cbl</samp>) will be calling three subprograms, named <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> (these are the <code>PROGRAM-ID</code>s of the three subprograms, and their source code may be found in the files <samp>A.cbl</samp>, <samp>B.cbl</samp> and <samp>C.cbl</samp>, respectively. </p> <p>Here is how these four programs would be compiled if the three subprograms are to be static: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cobc -x M.cbl A.cbl B.cbl C.cbl
</pre>
</div> <p>This command informs the compiler (cobc) that four programs are to be compiled (the first named on the command must always be the main program), and a single executable file is to be created (due to the   <samp>-x</samp> switch). </p> <p>Here is how the main program and the three subprograms could be compiled if the three subprograms are to be dynamic: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cobc -x M.cbl
cobc -m A.cbl B.cbl C.cbl
</pre>
</div> <p>These commands will create an executable file for the main program (<samp>-x</samp> switch) and three separate dynamically-loadable libraries (see   <samp>-m</samp> switch), one for each of the three subprograms. Had we wished, we could have created a single dynamically-loadable library containing all three subprograms by adding the   <samp>-b</samp> switch to their compilation: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cobc -m -b A.cbl B.cbl C.cbl
</pre>
</div> <p>Dynamically-loadable <i>libraries</i> are also known by the term dynamically-loadable <i>modules</i>. The two terms are synonymous. </p> <p>Here are the rules about GnuCOBOL dynamically-loadable modules: </p>
<ol> <li> There may be multiple GnuCOBOL subprograms contained within a single dynamically-loadable library if the <code>-b</code> switch is used in addition to <code>-m</code>. If not, each subprogram will be compiled to a separate dynamically-loadable library. </li>
<li> Dynamically-loadable modules will be named <samp><var>xxxxxxxx</var>.dll</samp> on a Windows system, <samp><var>xxxxxxxx</var>.so</samp> on a Unix system or <samp><var>xxxxxxxx</var>.dylib</samp> on an OSX system, where <samp><var>xxxxxxxx</var></samp> exactly matches, including the usage of upper- and lower-case letters, the primary entry-point name (<code>PROGRAM-ID</code> or <code>FUNCTION-ID</code>) or an alternate entry point name defined via the <code>ENTRY</code> statement (see <a href="#ENTRY">ENTRY</a>) of any one of the GnuCOBOL programs included in that module. </li>
<li> The first time any of the GnuCOBOL subprograms in a dynamically-loadable module are invoked, the entry-point referenced must be the one for which the <samp>.dll</samp>, <samp>.so</samp> or <samp>.dylib</samp> file is named. </li>
<li> When a dynamically-loadable module needs to be loaded (because it is not already in memory from a previous subprogram execution), the dynamically-loadable library will be sought in the same directory from which the main program was loaded. If it cannot be found there, each directory named in the   <code>PATH</code> run-time environment variable (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) will be searched. If it was not located in any of those directories, the library specified by the   <code>COB_LIBRARY_PATH</code> run-time environment variable will be searched. Finally, if it <i>still</i> cannot be located, execution will be terminated with an error message (<i>libcob: Cannot find module ’xxxxxxxx’</i>). </li>
<li> Once the dynamically-loadable module has been successfully loaded, any of the entry-points contained within it are now available for reference. </li>
<li> Dynamically-loadable modules may be removed from memory via the <code>CANCEL</code> statement (see <a href="#CANCEL">CANCEL</a>). </li>
<li> Once a dynamically-loadable module is actually loaded into memory, even if it is subsequently unloaded (via the <code>CANCEL</code> statement), its list of entry-points remain available to the GnuCOBOL run-time library and subsequent re-executions of any of those entry points will be able to bypass the search (rule #4) as well as the <i>first-execution rule</i> (rule #3). </li>
</ol> <p>Consult the documentation on the   <code>COB_PRE_LOAD</code> run-time environment variable,   <code>COB_PHYSICAL_CANCEL</code> run-time environment variable and   <code>COB_LOAD_CASE</code> run-time environment variable run-time environment variables (see <a href="#Run-Time-Environment-Variables">Run Time Environment Variables</a>) for additional options when using dynamically-loadable modules. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Subprogram-Execution-Flow">11.5.

<ol> <li> The calling program issues a statement of the form <code>CALL '<var>entry-point</var>' USING ...</code> to transfer control to the subroutine. </li>
<li> The executable for the called program will be located and loaded into memory: <ol> <li> If it is a static subroutine, it will already be part of the executable program issuing the <code>CALL</code> (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>). </li>
<li> If it is a dynamic subroutine, the GnuCOBOL run-time system will check to see if a dynamically-loadable module containing the subprogram’s entry point was already located.

</ol> </li>
<li> Execution of the calling program is suspended and control will transfer to the called program, as follows: <ol> <li> If the <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> (see <a href="#IDENTIFICATION-DIVISION">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</a>) clause of the subprogram included the  <code>INITIAL</code> clause, the program will be reinitialized back to its compile-time state.

<li> Local-storage, if any, will be allocated and initialized. </li>
<li> Execution will begin at the first executable statement following the subprograms entry-point. The entry point will be either the first executable statement following any <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) that might be present (if the subprogram was invoked using its primary entry-point name) or the first executable statement following the <code>ENTRY</code> statement (see <a href="#ENTRY">ENTRY</a>) naming the entry-point specified on the <code>CALL</code> if the subprogram was invoked using an alternate entry point. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li> The flow of execution will then progress through the coding of the subprogram as it would with any other program. </li>

<li> If the subprogram wishes to return control back to the calling program, it will do so using either the <code>GOBACK</code> statement (see <a href="#GOBACK">GOBACK</a>) or the <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code> statement (see <a href="#EXIT">EXIT</a>). At this time: <ol> <li> If the subprograms procedure division header or <code>ENTRY</code> statement included a  <code>RETURNING</code>, the value of the data item found on that clause is moved to the   <code>RETURN-CODE</code> special register (see <a href="#Special-Registers">Special Registers</a>); this behaviour can be altered utilizing the <code>CALL-CONVENTION</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) feature to leave <code>RETURN-CODE</code> unchanged. </li>
<li> Local-storage, if any, is de-allocated. </li>
<li> If the calling program included a <code>RETURNING</code> clause on the <code>CALL</code> statement that invoked the subprogram, the value of the <code>RETURNING</code> data item in the subroutine is moved to that data item.

There is no built-in GnuCOBOL limit to how many arguments a user-defined function may be passed. </p> <p>Whether or not changes made to an argument within a subroutine will be “visible” to the calling program depends on how the argument was passed. There are three ways in which arguments may be passed from a calling program to a subroutine, as defined by the use of optional <code>BY</code> clauses in the <code>CALL</code> (see <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>) statement’s list of arguments. </p> <p>As an example, the following statement passes three arguments to a subroutine — each argument is passed differently. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">CALL "subroutine" USING BY REFERENCE arg-1
                        BY CONTENT arg-2
                        BY VALUE arg-3

</pre>
</div> <p>The three ways arguments are passed are as follows. </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>BY REFERENCE</code></dt> <dd> <p>When a subroutine argument is passed  <code>BY REFERENCE</code>, the subroutine is passed the <i>address</i> of the <i>actual data item</i> being passed as an argument. The item may anything defined within the data division of the program. If the subroutine modifies the contents of this argument, the calling program will “see” the results of that change when the subroutine returns control. This is the default manner in which GnuCOBOL passes arguments to a subroutine, should no <code>BY</code> clauses be included on the <code>CALL</code>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>BY CONTENT</code></dt> <dd> <p>When a subroutine is passed an argument  <code>BY CONTENT</code>, the subroutine is passed the <i>address</i> of a <i>copy</i> of the actual data being passed as an argument. The item may anything defined within the data division of the program. The copy is made each time the <code>CALL</code> statement is executed, immediately before the <code>CALL</code> actually takes place. If the subroutine modifies the contents of this argument, it will be the <i>copy</i> that is modified, not the original data item; the calling program will therefore not “see” the results of that change when the subroutine returns control. </p> </dd> <dt><code>BY VALUE</code></dt> <dd> <p>Passing a subroutine argument  <code>BY VALUE</code> passes the <i>actual value</i> of the data being passed as an argument. The item may be any elementary binary numeric item defined within the data division of the program. If the subroutine modifies the contents of this argument, the calling program will not “see” the results of that change when the subroutine returns control. </p>
</dd> </dl> <p>The first two ways in which arguments may be passed (<code>BY REFERENCE</code> and <code>BY CONTENT</code>) are intended for use when a GnuCOBOL program is being called, while the first and third (<code>BY REFERENCE</code> and <code>BY VALUE</code>) are intended for use when a C program is being called. You <i>can</i> use <code>BY VALUE</code> arguments when calling GnuCOBOL subroutines, but remember that those arguments are limited to being a numeric binary data item. </p> <p>Arguments to user-defined functions are always passed <code>BY REFERENCE</code>. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="Called-Program-Considerations">11.6.1.2. Called Program Considerations</h3> <p>When coding a GnuCOBOL subprogram (a subroutine or user-defined function), all arguments to the subprogram must be defined in the subprogram’s linkage section. </p> <p>These arguments must be explicitly included on the <code>PROCEDURE DIVISION USING</code> (see <a href="#PROCEDURE-DIVISION-USING">PROCEDURE DIVISION USING</a>) clause that lists the arguments in the sequence in which they will be passed to the subprogram. </p> <p>These arguments described in the <code>PROCEDURE DIVISION USING</code> clause may each be defined as either <code>BY REFERENCE</code>, if the calling program is passing them either  <code>BY REFERENCE</code> or  <code>BY CONTENT</code>, or as  <code>BY VALUE</code> if they are being passed <code>BY VALUE</code>. </p> <p>By default, all arguments are assumed to be <code>BY REFERENCE</code> unless explicitly stated otherwise on the procedure division header. </p> <p>Arguments to a user-defined function are always to be specified as <code>BY REFERENCE</code> (either explicitly or by not using any <code>BY</code>). </p> <p>If the subprogram returns a value, the data item in which the value is returned must also be defined in the subprogram’s linkage section, with a <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) of <code>BINARY-LONG SIGNED</code>, or its equivalent. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="GLOBAL-Data-Items">11.6.2.

</div>      <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Combining-GnuCOBOL-and-C-Programs">11.8. Combining GnuCOBOL and C Programs</h2> <p>The upcoming sections deal the issues pertaining to calling C language programs from GnuCOBOL programs, and vice versa. Two additional sections provide samples illustrating specifics as to how those issues are overcome in actual program code. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="GnuCOBOL-Run_002dTime-Library-Requirements">11.8.1. GnuCOBOL Run-Time Library Requirements</h3> <p>Like most other implementations of the COBOL language, GnuCOBOL utilizes a run-time library. When the first program executed in a given execution sequence is a GnuCOBOL program, any run-time library initialization will be performed by the compiled COBOL code in a manner that is transparent to the C-language programmer. If, however, a C program is the first to execute, the burden of performing GnuCOBOL run-time library initialization falls upon the C program. See <a href="#C-Main-Programs-Calling-GnuCOBOL-Subprograms">C Main Programs Calling GnuCOBOL Subprograms</a>, for an example of how to do this. </p>     <h3 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="String-Allocation-Differences-Between-GnuCOBOL-and-C">11.8.2. String Allocation Differences Between GnuCOBOL and C</h3> <p>Both languages store strings as a fixed-length continuous sequence of characters. </p> <p>COBOL stores these character sequences up to a specific quantity limit imposed by the <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) clause of the data item. For example: <code>01  LastName   PIC X(15).</code>. </p> <p>There is never an issue of exactly what the length of a string contained in a <code>USAGE DISPLAY</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) data item is — there are always exactly how ever many characters as were allowed for by the <code>PICTURE</code> clause. In the example above, <code>LastName</code> will always contain exactly fifteen characters; of course, there may be anywhere from 0 to 15 trailing SPACES as part of the current LastName value. </p> <p>C actually has no “string” data type; it stores strings as an array of <code>char</code> data type items where each element of the array is a single character. Being an array, there is an upper limit to how many characters may be stored in a given “string”. For example: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">char lastName[15]; /* 15 chars: lastName[0] through lastName[14] */
</pre>
</div> <p>C provides a robust set of string-manipulation functions to copy strings from one char array to another, search strings for certain characters, compare one char array to another, concatenate char arrays and so forth. To make these functions possible, it was necessary to be able to define the logical end of a string. C accomplishes this via the expectation that all strings (char arrays) will be terminated by a NULL character (<code>x'00'</code>). Of course, no one forces a programmer to do this, but if [s]he ever expects to use any of the C standard functions to manipulate that string they had <i>better</i> be null-terminating their strings! </p> <p>So, GnuCOBOL programmers expecting to pass strings to or receive strings from C programs had best be prepared to deal with the null-termination issue, as follows: </p>
<ol> <li> Pass a quoted literal string from GnuCOBOL to C as a zero-delimited string literal (<code>Z'<var>string</var>'</code>). </li>
<li> Pass alphanumeric (<code>PIC X</code>) or alphabetic (<code>PIC A</code>) data items to C subroutines by appending an <small>ASCII</small> <code>NUL</code> character (<code>X'00'</code>) to them. For example, to pass the 15-character <code>LastName</code> data item described above to a C subroutine: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  LastName-Arg-to-C     PIC X(16).
...
    MOVE FUNCTION CONCATENATE(LastName,X'00') TO LastName-Arg-to-C
</pre>
</div> <p>And then pass <code>LastName-Arg-to-C</code> to the C subprogram! </p> </li>
<li> When a COBOL program needs to process string data prepared by a C program, the embedded null character must be accounted for. This can easily be accomplished with an <code>INSPECT</code> statement (see <a href="#INSPECT">INSPECT</a>) such as the following: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">INSPECT Data-From-a-C-Program
    REPLACING FIRST X'00' BY SPACE

</div> <p>The idea is to pass two string and one full-word unsigned arguments to the subprogram, have the subprogram print them out, change all three and pass a return code of 2 back to the caller. The caller will then re-display the three arguments (showing changes only to the two <code>BY REFERENCE</code> arguments), display the return code and halt. </p> <p>While simple, these two programs illustrate the techniques required quite nicely. </p> <p>Note how the COBOL program ensures that a null end-of-string terminator is present on both string arguments. </p> <p>Since the C program is planning on making changes to all three arguments, it declares all three as pointers in the function header and references the third argument as a pointer in the function body. It actually had no choice for the two string (char array) arguments — they must be defined as pointers in the function even though the function code references them without the leading ‘<samp>*</samp>’ that normally signifies pointers. </p> <p>These programs are compiled and executed as follows. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">$ cobc -x maincob.cbl subc.c

</div> <p>Since the C program is the one that will execute first, before the GnuCOBOL subroutine, the burden of initializing the GnuCOBOL run-time environment lies with that C program; it will have to invoke the <code>cob_init</code> function, which is part of the <code>libcob</code> library. The two required C statements are shown highlighted. </p> <p>The arguments to the <code>cob_init</code> routine are the argument count and value parameters passed to the main function when the program began execution. By passing them into the GnuCOBOL subprogram, it will be possible for that GnuCOBOL program to retrieve the command line or individual command-line arguments. If that won’t be necessary, <code>cob_init(0,NULL);</code> could be specified instead. </p> <p>Since the C program wants to allow <code>arg3</code> to be changed by the subprogram, it prefixes it with a ‘<samp>&amp;</samp>’ to force a <code>CALL BY REFERENCE</code> for that argument. Since <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> are strings (char arrays), they are automatically passed by reference. </p> <p>Here’s the output of the compilation process as well as the program’s execution. The example assumes a Windows system with a GnuCOBOL build that uses the GNU C compiler on that system; the technique works equally well regardless of which C compiler and which operating system you’re using. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">C:\Users\Gary\Documents\Programs&gt; cobc -S subcob.cbl

</div> <p>Note that even though we told GnuCOBOL that the 1st argument was to be <code>BY VALUE</code>, it was treated as if it were <code>BY REFERENCE</code> anyway. String (char array) arguments passed from C callers to GnuCOBOL subprograms will be modifiable by the subprogram. It’s best to pass a copy of such data if you want to ensure that the subprogram doesn’t change it. </p> <p>The third argument is different, however. Since it’s not an array you have the choice of passing it either <code>BY REFERENCE</code> or <code>BY VALUE</code>. </p>    <h2 class="unnumbered" id="Programming-Style-Suggestions">12. Programming Style Suggestions</h2>  <p>This chapter deals with a variety of stylistic issues that may be of interest to someone who is just starting out learning and using COBOL. Much of this chapter makes recommendations and suggestions for how to write your own programs. The sample programs in the <i>Sample Programs</i> document (see <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/gnucobsp.html#Top">Top</a> in <cite>Sample Programs</cite>) were coded using almost all of these recommendations. </p> <p>There’s no particular order of importance to the topics presented here. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Marking-Changes-in-Programs">12.1. Marking Changes in Programs</h2> <p>Historically in the early 60’s programs were first punched on to paper tape and by the mid 60’s that was replaced almost totally, by punched cards although paper tape was still used by programmers for the odd few changes to their sources held on magnetic tape or disk as a portable paper tape punch could be put in your pocket. Now the problem with punched cards were there was 2,000 cards per box and that they could and did, get dropped. So, cc (column) 1 through 6 had the card sequence number in and that way if a box was dropped they could be feed in to a card sorter to be fixed. This was after the cards was cleaned up so that they were all in the same direction which one corner cut out helped. </p> <p>In the late 70’s cards was also on its way out to the point where P.C’s started being used (and no they were not made by IBM), so these columns could be used for other purposes including cc 73 - 80 instead of indicating the 8 character program name which was the maximum size allowed on a IBM system. </p> <p>For quite a while now (back to the late 1970’s), the <i>sequence number area’</i> of a COBOL statement (columns 1-6) has come to be used as a change indicator area. Programmers would place a code in columns 1-6 of every line they changed in a program. The author works in a COBOL shop where change indicators of the form “xxmmyy” are required on every altered line of a program — “xx” is the initials of the programmer while “mmyy” are the month and two-digit year of the date the change was made. This is frequently accompanied by a comment block at or near the top of a COBOL program providing general documentation of what changes were made and what change indicator was used to mark that change. </p> <p>The GCic sample program source listing (see <a href="https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/HTML/gnucobsp.html#GCic">GCic</a> in <cite>GnuCOBOL Sample Programs</cite>) provides an excellent example of such documentation. </p> <p>This technique of using columns 1-6 as a change indicator will <i>only</i> work if fixed source-record format is in effect. </p> <p>Some COBOL shops prefer to use the eight-character Program Name Area (columns 73-80) as a change code area. </p> <p>Marking changes becomes more of a challenge when free-format source code is in effect. Creating a top-of-program comment block to generically describe changes that have been made isn’t difficult, even in free-form. What <i>is</i> difficult, however, is coming up with a scheme for per-statement mark up of changes that doesn’t introduce a ridiculously excessive number of source lines to the program. I’m not sure there is a good answer to this problem (if a reader has one, please let me know). Generally, I’ve noticed that shops using free-format conventions for their COBOL source tend to stick with just the top-of-program comment block combined with minimal comment blocks sprinkled throughout the program noting areas that underwent major changes. </p>     <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Data-Item-Coding-and-Naming-Conventions">12.2. Data Item Coding and Naming Conventions</h2> <p>When programs get very large, it becomes more and more challenging to keep track of the data items that will be used in the program. Here, in no particular order of importance, are a variety of conventions that can simply that problem. </p> <p>Remember that the points described here are intended to make things easier for you, the programmer. No COBOL compiler cares one way or another whether any of these suggestions are followed. </p>
<ol> <li> Avoid the use of level 77 data items in new programs. Once (1968 and before) there were valid reasons for creating level-77 data items, but since the 1974 ANSI standard of COBOL there really hasn’t been any reason why an elementary level-01 data item couldn’t have been used instead of a level-77 item. </li>
<li> Allocate level-01 data items in alphabetical sequence in the program source wherever practical. This will make it vastly easier to locate the definitions of 01-level items in the program source without having to resort to a compilation cross-reference listing and/or text editor “find” command to locate them. </li>
<li> <i>Consider</i> prefixing data items with an indication of where in the program structure they were created. For example: <ul> <li> Start everything defined in the file section with “F-” </li>
<li> Start everything defined in working-storage with “WS-” </li>
<li> Start everything defined in local-storage with “LS-” </li>
<li> Start everything defined in the linkage section with “L-” </li>
<li> Start everything defined in the screen section with “S-” </li>
<li> Start everything defined in the report section with “R-” </li>
</ul> <p>A convention such as this makes it simple, when you’re reviewing code in the procedure division, to know in which section of the data division you should look in when locating the detailed description of a data item. Once you’re in the right division, coding convention #2 will assist in locating the data item definition. </p> </li>
<li> Consider including a trailing descriptor of the nature of all data items in their names. The following chart presents a variety of such descriptors the author has encountered and used through the years. <dl compact> <dt><code>-ADDR</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The data item contains all or a part of an Address (<code>City-ADDR</code>, <code>State-ADDR</code>, <code>Street-ADDR</code>, …) </p> </dd> <dt><code>-BOOL</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A level-88 data item (which only has the value <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>) </p> </dd> <dt><code>-CD</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A <i>code</i> whose value denotes information content above and beyond that of the mere value itself. Some examples could be <code>Error-CD</code>, <code>Status-CD</code>, <code>Billing-CD</code> </p> </dd> <dt><code>-CHR</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A data item containing a single character of data. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-CONST</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A constant, specified as a level-78 data item, a level-01 item with the <code>CONST</code> attribute </p> </dd> <dt><code>-DT</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The data item contains a complete or partial date (<code>Birth-DT</code>, <code> Birth-Month-DT</code>, <code> Birth-Year-DT</code>, …) </p> </dd> <dt><code>-DTTM</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A data item containing both a date and a time </p> </dd> <dt><code>-FILE</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A file name. Note that these items would probably also have a “F-” prefix. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-IDX</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A data item used as a table index (see section 12.3) </p> </dd> <dt><code>-NM</code></dt> <dd>
<p>All or a portion of a person’s name. These could be extended to include business names, product names, etc. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-PTR</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A data item whose <code>USAGE</code> is <code>POINTER</code> </p> </dd> <dt><code>-NUM</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A generic numeric data item that doesn’t fit into any of the other categories </p> </dd> <dt><code>-QTY</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A count of something </p> </dd> <dt><code>-REC</code></dt> <dd>
<p>An 01-level item defined in the <code>FILE SECTION</code> (constituting the layout of a record within a file). Note that these items would probably also have a “F-” prefix. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-SCR</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The data item contains a complete or partial screen description (appropriate for SCREEN SECTION 01-level data items). </p> </dd> <dt><code>-SUB</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A numeric item used as a table subscript (see section 12.3) </p> </dd> <dt><code>-TEL</code></dt> <dd>
<p>All or part of a telephone number </p> </dd> <dt><code>-TM</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The data item contains a complete or partial time value </p> </dd> <dt><code>-TXT</code></dt> <dd><p>The data item contains generic alphanumeric text that doesn’t fit into any of the other categories. </p></dd> </dl> <p>The above is by no means an exhaustive list, but good programmers will use as few of these descriptors as possible as having too many defeats any benefits of such classification/documentation efforts. </p> </li>
<li> Consider including an acronym to be inserted into the name of any data item defined directly or indirectly subordinate to an 01-level item, typically to be specified after any section-level tag, if you’re using them. For example, consider the names used in the following structure: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">01  WS-File-Status-Message-TXT.
    05 FILLER                     PIC X(13) VALUE 'Status Code: '.
    05 WS-FSM-Status-CD           PIC 9(2).
    05 FILLER                     PIC X(11) VALUE ', Meaning: '.
    05 WS-FSM-Msg-TXT             PIC X(25).
</pre>
</div> <p>The “-FSM-” acronyms make it easier to locate the description of the 01-item the status code and message text items belong to. </p>
</li>
</ol>      <h2 class="unnumberedsec" id="Table-Subscripting-versus-Table-Indexing">12.3. Table Subscripting versus Table Indexing</h2> <p>The elements of a table may be referenced either using a subscript or an index. Syntactically, this is coded using parenthesis, as per the following three examples, all of which store the letter ‘<samp>A</samp>’ into the 17th occurrence of a data item named WSS-Output-Image-TXT: </p>
<ol> <li> <code>MOVE 'A' TO WSS-Output-Image-TXT (17)</code> </li>
<li> <code>MOVE 17 TO WSS-OI-SUB</code>  <code>MOVE 'A' TO WSS-Output-Image-TXT (WSS-OI-SUB)</code> </li>
<li> <code>SET WSS-OI-IDX TO 17</code>  <code>MOVE 'A' TO WSS-Output-Image-TXT (WSS-OI-IDX)</code> </li>
</ol> <p>The 1st and 2nd examples are referred to as  <em>Subscripting</em> while the 3rd is known as  <em>Indexing</em>. The distinction is fairly simple. </p> <p>Indexing is the process of referencing an element of a table utilizing a data item with an explicitly or implicitly defined <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>) of <code>INDEX</code> to select the desired occurrence, while … </p> <p>Subscripting is the process of referencing an element of a table utilizing either a numeric constant or an unedited numeric data item to select the desired occurrence. </p> <p>Various implementations of COBOL generate object code that is quite different in each of these three situations, and GnuCOBOL is no exception. </p> <p>In general, table references such as example #1 (constant subscript) generate the smallest, simplest and fastest object code while table references such as example #2 (numeric data item subscript) generate the largest, most-complicated and slowest object code. </p> <p>Table references such as example #3 (table indexing) generate object code that falls in the middle of the other two but is far closer in efficiency to example #1 than #2. </p> <p>Some COBOL statements (<code>SEARCH</code> (see <a href="#SEARCH">SEARCH</a>), <code>SEARCH ALL</code> (see <a href="#SEARCH-ALL">SEARCH ALL</a>) and the table-based <code>SORT</code> (see <a href="#Table-SORT">Table SORT</a>)) require you to index the affected table and to utilize that index with those statements. With any other references to tables, the choice is left to the programmer as to which approach should be used. In general, follow these rules: </p>
<ol> <li> Use constant subscripts (example #1) wherever possible/practical. </li>
<li> If references to table elements are going to be performed many, many times (tens or hundreds of thousands of times or more) during program execution, you will probably see a noticeable reduction in program execution time if you use indexing versus subscripting. </li>
</ol> <p>It’s impossible to perform any arithmetic operation against an index data item directly (other than a simple incrementation or decremental operation via the <code>SET UP/DOWN</code> statement (see <a href="#SET-UP_002fDOWN">SET UP/DOWN</a>)). Situations where any non-trivial computations are required to calculate the effective occurrence number for a table reference will require you to use a conventional unedited numeric data item as the receiving field for the calculation. That calculated value would then need to be saved into the index data item via a <code>SET Index</code> statement. </p> <p>If you only need to use the computed occurrence number once, you might as well just use the computed occurrence number data item as a subscript. If, however, you will need to use a computed “subscript” many more times than once, the run-time overhead of converting that occurrence value to an index (via <code>SET Index</code>) will be worth the coding effort. </p> <p>Whew! </p> <p>If references to table elements are not going to be performed many, many times it probably won’t make much difference whether you use indexing or subscripting. </p> <p>If you are comfortable with the C programming language, you might find the following simple GnuCOBOL program useful in exploring the differences between subscripting and indexing: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.

Copybook Naming Conventions and Usage</h2> <p>Since the intent of a copybook is to introduce COBOL code into a particular spot in a program via the <code>COPY</code> statement (see <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>), it is always a good idea to prefix copybook names with a character sequence that identifies where in a program its contents are intended to be <code>COPY</code>ed. </p> <p>For example: </p>
<dl compact> <dt><code>IDxxxxxxxx</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Copybooks containing code intended for the identification division. These will be rare as you almost never encounter copied code in the identification division. </p> </dd> <dt><code>EDxxxxxxxx</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Copybooks containing code intended for use in the environment division. These copybooks are generally used for predefined <code>SPECIAL-NAMES</code> (see <a href="#SPECIAL_002dNAMES">SPECIAL-NAMES</a>) or <code>FILE-CONTROL</code> (see <a href="#INPUT_002dOUTPUT-SECTION">INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION</a>) syntax, </p> </dd> <dt><code>DDxxxxxxxx</code></dt> <dd>

PROCEDURE DIVISION Sections Versus Paragraphs</h2> <p>The issue of whether to use section and/or paragraph names (collectively referred to as procedure names) within the procedure division is one of near religious significance with many COBOL programmers. </p> <p>COBOL programming standards used by many organizations that use the language generally call for procedure names to: </p>
<ol> <li> Contain a leading numeric component (for example: <code>2000-Update-Customer</code>), AND… </li>
<li> Be defined in the procedure division in non-decreasing sequence of that numeric component. </li>
</ol> <p>When you are looking at or editing any large COBOL program that has been created with programming standards that include these two rules, it is always a simple thing to know whether a reference to a procedure is being made to code that exists before or after your current location in the program, simply by comparing the numeric component of the current procedure’s name with the one in question. </p> <p>Technically, GnuCOBOL does not require ANY procedure names be defined unless: </p>
<ol> <li> You are using the <code>ALTER</code> statement (see <a href="#ALTER">ALTER</a>) (the use of which should be avoided at all costs) </li>
<li> You are using a procedural <code>PERFORM</code> statement (see <a href="#Procedural-PERFORM">Procedural PERFORM</a>) </li>
<li> You are using a <code>GO TO</code> statement (see <a href="#GO-TO">GO TO</a>) </li>
<li> You are using a <code>MERGE</code> statement (see <a href="#MERGE">MERGE</a>) with an <code>OUTPUT PROCEDURE</code> </li>
<li> You are using a <code>SORT</code> statement (see <a href="#SORT">SORT</a>) with either (or both) an <code>INPUT PROCEDURE</code> or <code>OUTPUT PROCEDURE</code> </li>
<li> You are using <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) </li>
</ol> <p>Since it is difficult to write any non-trivial COBOL program that uses none of the above, lets assume you will be including at least one section or paragraph in your GnuCOBOL programs. </p> <p>I like to use procedure division paragraphs and sections as follows: </p>
<ol> <li> The very first procedure defined in the procedure division of my programs, assuming no <code>DECLARATIVES</code> (see <a href="#DECLARATIVES">DECLARATIVES</a>) are defined, will be a section named <code>000-Main</code>. The declaration of this procedure will immediately follow the procedure division header (or <code>END DECLARATIVES</code> if <code>DECLARATIVES</code> are used). </li>
<li> Any procedures referenced by <code>MERGE</code>, <code>PERFORM</code>, or <code>SORT</code> statements will be defined as sections. </li>
<li> Any procedures referenced by <code>GO TO</code> statements will be defined as paragraphs, and those paragraphs will be defined in the same section as the <code>GO TO</code> statements that reference them. In other words, <code>GO TO</code> statements may not be used to transfer control to a point in a different section. This is <i>not</i> a GnuCOBOL rule — this is my own personal programming practice intended to improve the readability and maintainability of my programs. </li>
<li> I always include a numeric prefix to all procedure names I define, for the reasons stated earlier. </li>
<li> I do not use <code>THRU</code> on any <code>MERGE</code>, <code>PERFORM</code> or <code>SORT</code> statement unless the programming standards of the shop in which I am working require it. My reasoning for this is that it is too easy to accidentally introduce a new procedure into the scope of a <code>THRU</code>. </li>

COMPUTE Versus ADD-SUBTRACT-MULTIPLY-DIVIDE</h2> <p>Over the years, there has been much debate over the efficiency and arithmetic accuracy of using the <code>COMPUTE</code> statement (see <a href="#COMPUTE">COMPUTE</a>) rather than the four basic arithmetic operation statements. </p> <p>Here are the facts — draw your own conclusions as to which approach is more appropriate under which circumstances. </p>
<ol> <li> The <code>COMPUTE</code> statement supports exponentiation (via the ‘<samp>**</samp>’ operator) — there is no equivalent basic arithmetic statement. Although you could simulate integral exponentiation (raising a value to the third power, for example) using <code>MULTIPLY</code> statements, and you may use the <code>SQRT</code> intrinsic function (see <a href="#SQRT">SQRT</a>) to find a square root, there’s just no (easy) way to find the cube-root of a value without using the <code>COMPUTE</code> statement. </li>
<li> For non-trivial computations, <code>COMPUTE</code> statements “read” better. Take this, for example: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">COMPUTE R = (A + B * C) / D
</pre>
</div> <p>As compared to: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">MULTIPLY B BY C GIVING TEMP
ADD A TO TEMP
DIVIDE TEMP BY D GIVING R
</pre>
</div> <p>For non-trivial computations, <code>COMPUTE</code> statements may execute faster than the equivalent chain of basic arithmetic statements. For example, the COMPUTE statement shown above executes about 25% faster on my computer using GnuCOBOL than does the MULTIPLY-ADD-DIVIDE sequence. </p> </li>
<li> For trivial computations, on the other hand, I prefer the inherent readability of a statement such as this: <div class="example"> <pre class="example">ADD 1 TO WSS-Input-Trans-QTY
</pre>
</div> <p>to this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">COMPUTE WS-Input-Trans-QTY = WS-Input-Trans-QTY + 1
</pre>

 <p>The sequence in which the characters that are acceptable to a computer are ordered for purposes of all types of sorting, merging, comparing, and processing. GnuCOBOL programs may utilize standard character-set collating sequences (such as that defined by the ASCII or EBCDIC character sets) or programmer-defined custom sequences as specified in the OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph (section 4.1.2) and defined in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph (section 4.1.4). </p> </dd> <dt><em>Compilation Group</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>The collection of all compilation units being compiled by a single execution of the GnuCOBOL compiler. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Compilation Unit</em></dt> <dd>

 <p>An event that is triggered when a control field on an RWCS-generated report changes value. It is these events that trigger the generation of control heading and control footing groups. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Control Field</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A field of data being presented within a detail group; as the various detail groups that comprise the report are presented, they are presumed to appear in sorted sequence of the control fields contained within them. As an example, a department-by-department sales report for a chain of stores would probably be sorted by store number and – within like store numbers – be further sorted by department number. The store number will undoubtedly serve as a control field for the report, allowing control heading groups to be presented before each sequence of detail groups for the same store and control footing groups to be presented after each such sequence. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Control Footing</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that appears immediately after one or more detail groups of an RWCS-generated report. Such are produced automatically as a result of a control break. This type of group typically serves as a summary of the detail group(s) that precede it, as might be the case on a sales report for a chain of stores, where the detail groups documenting sales for each department (one department per detail group) from the same store might be followed by a control footing that provides a summation of the department-by-department sales for that store. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Control Heading</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that appears immediately before one or more detail groups of an RWCS-generated report. Such are produced automatically as a result of a control break. This type of group typically serves as an introduction to the detail group(s) that follow, as might be the case on a sales report for a chain of stores, where the detail groups documenting sales for each department (one department per detail group) from the same store might be preceded by a control heading that states the full name and location of the store. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Control Hierarchy</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>The natural hierarchy of control breaks within a RWCS-controlled report based upon the manner in which the data the report is being generated from is sorted. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Copybook</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A segment of program code that may be utilized by multiple programs simply by having that program use the <code>COPY</code> statement to import that code into the program. Although similar to the “include” facility present in many other programming languages, the COBOL copybook mechanism is actually considerably more powerful. See <a href="#Copybooks">Copybooks</a>, for a general discussion. See <a href="#COPY">COPY</a>, for the specifics of the <code>COPY</code> statement. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Data Item</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A contiguous area of storage within the memory space of a program that may be referenced, by name, in a COBOL program. Other programming languages use the term variable, property or attribute to describe the same concept.

 <p>A report group that contains the detailed data being presented for the report. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Detail Report</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>An RWCS-generated report to which at least one type of detail group is presented. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Division</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A collection of zero, one, or more sections of paragraphs, called the division body, that are formed and combined in accordance with a specific set of rules. Each division consists of the division header and the related division body. There are four divisions in a GnuCOBOL program: Identification, Environment, Data, and Procedure (coded in that sequence). See <a href="#Program-Structure">Program Structure</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Dynamic Subprogram</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A subprogram whose executable object code is contained in a different executable file as its calling program. Dynamic subprograms are therefore loaded into memory as needed. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Elementary Item</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A data item that isn’t itself comprised of other data items. See <a href="#Structured-Data">Structured Data</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Entry-point</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A spot in the procedure division where a program may begin execution when it is executed from the operating system, invoked as a user-defined function or called by another program. </p> <p>Every program has at least one entry-point — known as the primary entry-point — which corresponds to the first executable statement in the procedure division following the declaratives area, if any. </p> <p>Additional entry-points may be defined via the <code>ENTRY</code> statement (see <a href="#ENTRY">ENTRY</a>). </p> </dd> <dt><em>Entry-point Name</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>Every entry-point has a name. That name must be unique for all programs that comprise an executable program. Entry-point names are defined using a subroutine’s <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> paragraph, a user-defined function’s <code>FUNCTION-ID</code> paragraph or via <code>ENTRY</code> (see <a href="#ENTRY">ENTRY</a>) statements coded in a subprogram’s procedure division. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Executable File</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>The GnuCOBOL compiler can create operating-system appropriate files that may be executed directly from the operating system environment. On Windows systems, these will be <samp>.exe</samp> files whereas on UNIX systems they will have no specific extensions. The compiler’s   <samp>-x</samp> switch is used to create executable files. Only main programs should be compiled in this manner. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Execution Thread</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>The complete set of executable code that is run during the execution of a program. This includes the main program as well as all executed subprograms, including those that are both dynamically and statically loaded. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Figurative Constants</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>GnuCOBOL, like other COBOL implementations, supports a number of reserved words that may be used to represent a specific literal value. These are known as figurative constants. See <a href="#Figurative-Constants">Figurative Constants</a>, for more information. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Fixed Format Mode</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A mode of the GnuCOBOL compiler’s operation where source statements are constrained to meeting the pre-2002 standard of limiting COBOL statements to 80 columns, with various columns having limitations as to what sort of COBOL syntax could be specified in them. See <a href="#Format-of-Program-Source-Lines">Format of Program Source Lines</a>, for more information. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Free Format Mode</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A mode of the GnuCOBOL compiler’s operation where source statements are allowed to be as long as 255 characters, with no restrictions or requirements as to in which columns various syntax elements must appear. See <a href="#Format-of-Program-Source-Lines">Format of Program Source Lines</a>, for more information. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Group Item</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A hierarchical data structure where the group item — itself a data item — actually consists of two or more other contiguously allocated data items. For example, <code>Employee-Name</code> could be a 35-character data item consisting of a 20-character <code>Last-Name</code> data item followed by a 14-character <code>First-Name</code> and a 1-character <code>Middle-Initial</code>. See <a href="#Structured-Data">Structured Data</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Hexadecimal Alphanumeric Literal</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>These are alphanumeric literals whose character sequence is specified by hexadecimal value. These literals are formed by a quote- or apostrophe-delimited sequence of an even number of hexadecimal digits (upper- or lower-case), prefixed with the letter ‘<samp>X</samp>’ (also upper- or lower-case). For example, the character string “<code>Demo</code>” could be specified as the hexadecimal alphanumeric literal <code>X'44656D6F'</code>, assuming the ASCII character set. See <a href="#Alphanumeric-Literals">Alphanumeric Literals</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Hexadecimal Numeric Literal</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A numeric literal whose value is specified by hexadecimal value. These literals are formed by a quote- or apostrophe-delimited sequence of from 1 to 16 hexadecimal digits (upper- or lower-case), prefixed with the letter ‘<samp>H</samp>’ (also upper- or lower-case). For example, the number 123456 could be specified as the hexadecimal numeric literal <code>H'01E240'</code>. See <a href="#Numeric-Literals">Numeric Literals</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Identifiers</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>These are data items a COBOL program will be working with. The vast majority of identifiers are defined by the user (programmer) while a few are pre-defined by the GnuCOBOL compiler. Identifiers pre-defined by the compiler are referred to as special registers. Other programming languages generally refer to identifiers as “variables”. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Imperative Statement</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>Either a statement that begins with a non decision-making verb and specifies an unconditional action to be taken or a conditional verb such as <code>IF</code> or <code>EVALUATE</code>, delimited by its explicit scope terminator (such as <code>END-IF</code> or <code>END-EVALUATE</code>). An imperative statement can consist of a sequence of imperative statements. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Intrinsic Function</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A built-in routine that accepts arguments and returns a value; syntactically, these may be used most places where GnuCOBOL identifiers are valid. See <a href="#Intrinsic-Functions">Intrinsic Functions</a>, for documentation on all the GnuCOBOL intrinsic functions. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Level Number</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A 1- or 2-digit number that indicates the hierarchical position of a data item in a group item or the special properties of a data description entry. </p> <p>Level numbers in the range 1 through 49 indicate the position of a data item in the hierarchical structure of a logical record. Level numbers in the range 1 through 9 can be written either as a single digit or as a zero followed by the significant digit. </p> <p>Level numbers 66, 77, 78 and 88 identify special properties of a data description entry. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Literal</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A generic term used for a constant value coded in a program that may be either a numeric literal or an alphanumeric literal. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Main program</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A program that is executed directly from an operating system or shell event. Main programs are not executed from other programs (i.e. they are not called programs). </p> </dd> <dt><em>National Character set</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A character set that supports symbols using other than the traditional Roman alphabet symbols used by the ASCII character set. Typically, such a character set uses a UTF-16 (i.e. 16 bits-per-character) encoding of the Unicode character set. </p> <p>Support for national character sets in GnuCOBOL is currently only partially implemented, and the compile- and run-time effect of using the <code>N</code> symbol in a <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) clause to define a field as containing national characters is the same as if <code>X(2)</code> had been coded, with the additional effect that such a field will qualify as a <code>NATIONAL</code> or <code>NATIONAL-EDITED</code> field on an <code>INITIALIZE</code> (see <a href="#INITIALIZE">INITIALIZE</a>) statement. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Numeric Data Item</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A data item whose <code>PICTURE</code> clause allows it to contain only the numeric digit characters <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> (signed or unsigned), or a data item whose <code>PICTURE</code>/<code>USAGE</code> combination allow it to contain actual binary numbers in integer, fixed-point, floating-point or packed-decimal format. Numeric data items are the only ones that may be used as table subscripts or as source arguments on arithmetic statements. <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>), or <code>USAGE</code> (see <a href="#USAGE">USAGE</a>). </p> </dd> <dt><em>Numeric Edited Data Item</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>An otherwise numeric data item whose <code>PICTURE</code> (see <a href="#PICTURE">PICTURE</a>) clause also contains any of the editing symbols ‘<samp>$</samp>’, ‘<samp>*</samp>’, ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>,</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, ‘<samp>.</samp>’, ‘<samp>/</samp>’, ‘<samp>0</samp>’ (zero), ‘<samp>B</samp>’, ‘<samp>CR</samp>’, ‘<samp>DB</samp>’ or ‘<samp>Z</samp>’. Numeric edited data items are not eligible to serve as table subscripts or source arguments on arithmetic statements. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Numeric Literal</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A numeric constant. See <a href="#Numeric-Literals">Numeric Literals</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Page Footing</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that appears at the bottom of every page of an RWCS-generated report. Information typically found within such a report group might be: </p> <ul> <li> The date the report was generated </li>
<li> The current page number of the report </li>
</ul> </dd> <dt><em>Page Heading</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that appears at the top of every page of an RWCS-generated report. Information typically found within such a report group might be: </p> <ul> <li> A title for the report </li>

 <p>A GnuCOBOL main program or subprogram. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Qualification</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>The process of establishing a unique reference to a data item whose name is duplicated in a program. This takes the form of using the duplicated data name and the name of any of its parent data items, connected by <code>OF</code> or <code>IN</code> such that the combination of those two data names is unique within the program. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Record</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A group item that is not part of a higher-level group item. See <a href="#Data-Definition-Principles">Data Definition Principles</a>. An elementary item with a level number of 01 can also be referred to as a record if its definition occurs in the file section, provided that its definition does not include the <code>CONSTANT</code> attribute. See <a href="#FILE_002dSECTION_002dData_002dItem">FILE-SECTION-Data-Item</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Report Footing</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that occurs only once in an RWCS-generated report — as the very last presented report group of the report. These typically serve as a visual indication that the report is finished. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Report Group</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>One or more consecutive lines on a report that serve a common informational purpose or function. For example, lines of text that are displayed at the top or bottom of every printed page of a report. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Report Heading</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A report group that occurs only once in an RWCS-generated report — as the very first presented report group of the report. These typically serve as an introduction to the report. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Reserved Word</em></dt> <dd>
 <p>A word coded in a GnuCOBOL program without any quote or apostrophe characters around it (which would have transformed that sequence of characters into a literal string) which has a very specific meaning to the compiler.

 <p>Either the name of an identifier or a procedure in the program. GnuCOBOL limits user-defined names to a maximum of 31 characters taken from the set of numeric digits, upper- and lower-case letters, hyphens and underscores. A user-defined name may neither begin nor end with a hyphen or underscore. User-defined names used as file names may additionally not begin with a digit although - unlike many other programming languages - user-defined names used as identifiers or procedure names may. </p> </dd> <dt><em>Verb</em></dt> <dd>

 <p>An alphanumeric literal prefixed with an upper- or lower-case ‘<samp>Z</samp>’ character — for example, <code>Z'ABC'</code>. These literals are one character longer than the value within apostrophes or quotes would make them appear. The extra character (the last character) will be a null character (comprised entirely of zero bits). These literals are ideal when defining or assigning values to alphanumeric data items that will be passed as arguments to a C subroutine.
