<p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails.</p>
<p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">Official Ruby Programming Language website</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#ruby">List of Free Programming Books</a></li> </ul> <p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as 1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-rails-questionmark"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-is-rails-questionmark">2 What is Rails?</a></h2>
<p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>
<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>
<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself:</strong> DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li> <li> <strong>Convention Over Configuration:</strong> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li> </ul> <h2 id="creating-a-new-rails-project"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-a-new-rails-project">3 Creating a New Rails Project</a></h2>
<p>The best way to read this guide is to follow it step by step. All steps are essential to run this example application and no additional code or steps are needed.</p>
<p>By following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called <code>blog</code>, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.</p>
<div class="info"><p>The examples below use <code>$</code> to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS, though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows, your prompt will look something like <code>c:\source_code&gt;</code></p></div>
<h3 id="installing-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#installing-rails">3.1 Installing Rails</a></h3>
<p>Before you install Rails, you should check to make sure that your system has the proper prerequisites installed. These include Ruby and SQLite3.</p>
<p>Open up a command line prompt. On macOS open Terminal.app, on Windows choose "Run" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign <code>$</code> should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:</p> <pre>$ ruby -v
ruby 2.5.0</pre>  <p>Rails requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or later. If the version number returned is less than that number, you'll need to install a fresh copy of Ruby.</p>
<div class="info"><p>To quickly install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your system in Windows, you can use <a href="http://railsinstaller.org">Rails Installer</a>. For more installation methods for most Operating Systems take a look at <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</p></div>
<p>If you are working on Windows, you should also install the <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Ruby Installer Development Kit</a>.</p>
<p>You will also need an installation of the SQLite3 database. Many popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. On Windows, if you installed Rails through Rails Installer, you already have SQLite installed. Others can find installation instructions at the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite3 website</a>. Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH:</p> <pre>$ sqlite3 --version</pre>  <p>The program should report its version.</p>
<p>To install Rails, use the <code>gem install</code> command provided by RubyGems:</p> <pre>$ gem install rails</pre>  <p>To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:</p> <pre>$ rails --version</pre>  <p>If it says something like "Rails 6.0.0", you are ready to continue.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-blog-application"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-the-blog-application">3.2 Creating the Blog Application</a></h3>
<p>Rails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have to write it yourself.</p>
<p>To use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:</p> <pre>$ rails new blog</pre>  <p>This will create a Rails application called Blog in a <code>blog</code> directory and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in <code>Gemfile</code> using <code>bundle install</code>.</p>
<div class="note"><p>If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux then there are currently some limitations on file system notifications that mean you should disable the <code>spring</code> and <code>listen</code> gems which you can do by running <code>rails new blog --skip-spring --skip-listen</code>.</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>You can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running <code>rails new -h</code>.</p></div>
<p>After you create the blog application, switch to its folder:</p> <pre>$ cd blog</pre>  <p>The <code>blog</code> directory has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of a Rails application. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the <code>app</code> folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each of the files and folders that Rails created by default:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>File/Folder</th> <th>Purpose</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>app/</td> <td>Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs, and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>bin/</td> <td>Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, update, deploy, or run your application.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>config/</td> <td>Configure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in <a href="configuring">Configuring Rails Applications</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>config.ru</td> <td>Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application. For more information about Rack, see the <a href="https://rack.github.io/">Rack website</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>db/</td> <td>Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemfile<br>Gemfile.lock</td> <td>These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler website</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>lib/</td> <td>Extended modules for your application.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>log/</td> <td>Application log files.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>package.json</td> <td>This file allows you to specify what npm dependencies are needed for your Rails application. This file is used by Yarn. For more information about Yarn, see the <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/">Yarn website</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>public/</td> <td>The only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rakefile</td> <td>This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing <code>Rakefile</code>, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the <code>lib/tasks</code> directory of your application.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>README.md</td> <td>This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>storage/</td> <td>Active Storage files for Disk Service. This is covered in <a href="active_storage_overview">Active Storage Overview</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test/</td> <td>Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in <a href="testing">Testing Rails Applications</a>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>tmp/</td> <td>Temporary files (like cache and pid files).</td> </tr> <tr> <td>vendor/</td> <td>A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>.gitignore</td> <td>This file tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files">GitHub - Ignoring files</a> for more info about ignoring files.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>.ruby-version</td> <td>This file contains the default Ruby version.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="hello-rails-bang"><a class="anchorlink" href="#hello-rails-bang">4 Hello, Rails!</a></h2>
<p>To begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to get your Rails application server running.</p>
<h3 id="starting-up-the-web-server"><a class="anchorlink" href="#starting-up-the-web-server">4.1 Starting up the Web Server</a></h3>
<p>You actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following in the <code>blog</code> directory:</p> <pre>$ rails server</pre>  <div class="info"><p>If you are using Windows, you have to pass the scripts under the <code>bin</code> folder directly to the Ruby interpreter e.g. <code>ruby bin\rails server</code>.</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>JavaScript asset compression requires you have a JavaScript runtime available on your system, in the absence of a runtime you will see an <code>execjs</code> error during asset compilation. Usually macOS and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed. <code>therubyrhino</code> is the recommended runtime for JRuby users and is added by default to the <code>Gemfile</code> in apps generated under JRuby. You can investigate all the supported runtimes at <a href="https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme">ExecJS</a>.</p></div>
<p>This will fire up Puma, a web server distributed with Rails by default. To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to <span>http://localhost:3000</span>. You should see the Rails default information page:</p>

<div class="info"><p>To stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running. To verify the server has stopped you should see your command prompt cursor again. For most UNIX-like systems including macOS this will be a dollar sign <code>$</code>. In development mode, Rails does not generally require you to restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by the server.</p></div>
<p>The "Welcome aboard" page is the <em>smoke test</em> for a new Rails application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page.</p>
<h3 id="say-hello-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#say-hello-rails">4.2 Say "Hello", Rails</a></h3>
<p>To get Rails saying "Hello", you need to create at minimum a <em>controller</em> and a <em>view</em>.</p>
<p>A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. <em>Routing</em> decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different <em>actions</em>. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.</p>
<p>A view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. An important distinction to make is that it is the <em>controller</em>, not the view, where information is collected. The view should just display that information. By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.</p>
<p>To create a new controller, you will need to run the "controller" generator and tell it you want a controller called "Welcome" with an action called "index", just like this:</p> <pre>$ rails generate controller Welcome index</pre>  <p>Rails will create several files and a route for you.</p> <pre>create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
 route  get 'welcome/index'
invoke  erb
create    app/views/welcome
create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
invoke  test_unit
create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
invoke  helper
create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
invoke    test_unit
invoke  assets
invoke    scss
create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss</pre>  <p>Most important of these are of course the controller, located at <code>app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb</code> and the view, located at <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code>.</p>
<p>Open the <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code> file in your text editor. Delete all of the existing code in the file, and replace it with the following single line of code:</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Rails!&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>  <h3 id="setting-the-application-home-page"><a class="anchorlink" href="#setting-the-application-home-page">4.3 Setting the Application Home Page</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell Rails when we want "Hello, Rails!" to show up. In our case, we want it to show up when we navigate to the root URL of our site, <span>http://localhost:3000</span>. At the moment, "Welcome aboard" is occupying that spot.</p>
<p>Next, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is located.</p>
<p>Open the file <code>config/routes.rb</code> in your editor.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end</pre>  <p>This is your application's <em>routing file</em> which holds entries in a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL (domain-specific language)</a> that tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions. Edit this file by adding the line of code <code>root 'welcome#index'</code>. It should look something like the following:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  root 'welcome#index'
end</pre>  <p><code>root 'welcome#index'</code> tells Rails to map requests to the root of the application to the welcome controller's index action and <code>get 'welcome/index'</code> tells Rails to map requests to <span>http://localhost:3000/welcome/index</span> to the welcome controller's index action. This was created earlier when you ran the controller generator (<code>rails generate controller Welcome index</code>).</p>
<p>Launch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the controller (<code>rails
server</code>) and navigate to <span>http://localhost:3000</span> in your browser. You'll see the "Hello, Rails!" message you put into <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code>, indicating that this new route is indeed going to <code>WelcomeController</code>'s <code>index</code> action and is rendering the view correctly.</p>
<div class="info"><p>For more information about routing, refer to <a href="routing">Rails Routing from the Outside In</a>.</p></div>
<h2 id="getting-up-and-running"><a class="anchorlink" href="#getting-up-and-running">5 Getting Up and Running</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen how to create a controller, an action, and a view, let's create something with a bit more substance.</p>
<p>In the Blog application, you will now create a new <em>resource</em>. A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people, or animals. You can create, read, update, and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as <em>CRUD</em> operations.</p>
<p>Rails provides a <code>resources</code> method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource. You need to add the <em>article resource</em> to the <code>config/routes.rb</code> so the file will look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  resources :articles

  root 'welcome#index'
end</pre>  <p>If you run <code>rails routes</code>, you'll see that it has defined routes for all the standard RESTful actions. The meaning of the prefix column (and other columns) will be seen later, but for now notice that Rails has inferred the singular form <code>article</code> and makes meaningful use of the distinction.</p> <pre>$ rails routes
       Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
welcome_index GET    /welcome/index(.:format)     welcome#index
     articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index
              POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create
  new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new
 edit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit
      article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show
              PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update
              PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update
              DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy
         root GET    /                            welcome#index</pre>  <p>In the next section, you will add the ability to create new articles in your application and be able to view them. This is the "C" and the "R" from CRUD: create and read. The form for doing this will look like this:</p>

<p>It will look a little basic for now, but that's ok. We'll look at improving the styling for it afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="laying-down-the-groundwork"><a class="anchorlink" href="#laying-down-the-groundwork">5.1 Laying down the groundwork</a></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need a place within the application to create a new article. A great place for that would be at <code>/articles/new</code>. With the route already defined, requests can now be made to <code>/articles/new</code> in the application. Navigate to <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> and you'll see a routing error:</p>

<p>This error occurs because the route needs to have a controller defined in order to serve the request. The solution to this particular problem is simple: create a controller called <code>ArticlesController</code>. You can do this by running this command:</p> <pre>$ rails generate controller Articles</pre>  <p>If you open up the newly generated <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> you'll see a fairly empty controller:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
end</pre>  <p>A controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit from <code>ApplicationController</code>. It's inside this class that you'll define methods that will become the actions for this controller. These actions will perform CRUD operations on the articles within our system.</p>
<div class="note"><p>There are <code>public</code>, <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> methods in Ruby, but only <code>public</code> methods can be actions for controllers. For more details check out <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby</a>.</p></div>
<p>If you refresh <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> now, you'll get a new error:</p>

<p>This error indicates that Rails cannot find the <code>new</code> action inside the <code>ArticlesController</code> that you just generated. This is because when controllers are generated in Rails they are empty by default, unless you tell it your desired actions during the generation process.</p>
<p>To manually define an action inside a controller, all you need to do is to define a new method inside the controller. Open <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> and inside the <code>ArticlesController</code> class, define the <code>new</code> method so that your controller now looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end
end</pre>  <p>With the <code>new</code> method defined in <code>ArticlesController</code>, if you refresh <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> you'll see another error:</p>

<p>You're getting this error now because Rails expects plain actions like this one to have views associated with them to display their information. With no view available, Rails will raise an exception.</p>
<p>Let's look at the full error message again:</p> <blockquote> <p>ArticlesController#new is missing a template for request formats: text/html</p> <p>NOTE! Unless told otherwise, Rails expects an action to render a template with the same name, contained in a folder named after its controller. If this controller is an API responding with 204 (No Content), which does not require a template, then this error will occur when trying to access it via browser, since we expect an HTML template to be rendered for such requests. If that's the case, carry on.</p> </blockquote> <p>The message identifies which template is missing. In this case, it's the <code>articles/new</code> template. Rails will first look for this template. If not found, then it will attempt to load a template called <code>application/new</code>, because the <code>ArticlesController</code> inherits from <code>ApplicationController</code>.</p>
<p>Next the message contains <code>request.formats</code> which specifies the format of template to be served in response. It is set to <code>text/html</code> as we requested this page via browser, so Rails is looking for an HTML template.</p>
<p>The simplest template that would work in this case would be one located at <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code>. The extension of this file name is important: the first extension is the <em>format</em> of the template, and the second extension is the <em>handler</em> that will be used to render the template. Rails is attempting to find a template called <code>articles/new</code> within <code>app/views</code> for the application. The format for this template can only be <code>html</code> and the default handler for HTML is <code>erb</code>. Rails uses other handlers for other formats. <code>builder</code> handler is used to build XML templates and <code>coffee</code> handler uses CoffeeScript to build JavaScript templates. Since you want to create a new HTML form, you will be using the <code>ERB</code> language which is designed to embed Ruby in HTML.</p>
<p>Therefore the file should be called <code>articles/new.html.erb</code> and needs to be located inside the <code>app/views</code> directory of the application.</p>
<p>Go ahead now and create a new file at <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code> and write this content in it:</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;h1&gt;New Article&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>  <p>When you refresh <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> you'll now see that the page has a title. The route, controller, action, and view are now working harmoniously! It's time to create the form for a new article.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-form"><a class="anchorlink" href="#the-first-form">5.2 The first form</a></h3>
<p>To create a form within this template, you will use a <em>form builder</em>. The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper method called <code>form_with</code>. To use this method, add this code into <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with scope: :article, local: true do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :title %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :text %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :text %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>  <p>If you refresh the page now, you'll see the exact same form from our example above. Building forms in Rails is really just that easy!</p>
<p>When you call <code>form_with</code>, you pass it an identifying scope for this form. In this case, it's the symbol <code>:article</code>. This tells the <code>form_with</code> helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this method, the <code>FormBuilder</code> object - represented by <code>form</code> - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. Finally, a call to <code>submit</code> on the <code>form</code> object will create a submit button for the form.</p>
<p>There's one problem with this form though. If you inspect the HTML that is generated, by viewing the source of the page, you will see that the <code>action</code> attribute for the form is pointing at <code>/articles/new</code>. This is a problem because this route goes to the very page that you're on right at the moment, and that route should only be used to display the form for a new article.</p>
<p>The form needs to use a different URL in order to go somewhere else. This can be done quite simply with the <code>:url</code> option of <code>form_with</code>. Typically in Rails, the action that is used for new form submissions like this is called "create", and so the form should be pointed to that action.</p>
<p>Edit the <code>form_with</code> line inside <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code> to look like this:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with scope: :article, url: articles_path, local: true do |form| %&gt;</pre>  <p>In this example, the <code>articles_path</code> helper is passed to the <code>:url</code> option. To see what Rails will do with this, we look back at the output of <code>rails routes</code>:</p> <pre>$ rails routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
welcome_index GET    /welcome/index(.:format)     welcome#index
     articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index
              POST   /articles(.:format)          articles#create
  new_article GET    /articles/new(.:format)      articles#new
 edit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format) articles#edit
      article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show
              PATCH  /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update
              PUT    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#update
              DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy
         root GET    /                            welcome#index</pre>  <p>The <code>articles_path</code> helper tells Rails to point the form to the URI Pattern associated with the <code>articles</code> prefix; and the form will (by default) send a <code>POST</code> request to that route. This is associated with the <code>create</code> action of the current controller, the <code>ArticlesController</code>.</p>
<p>With the form and its associated route defined, you will be able to fill in the form and then click the submit button to begin the process of creating a new article, so go ahead and do that. When you submit the form, you should see a familiar error:</p>

<p>You now need to create the <code>create</code> action within the <code>ArticlesController</code> for this to work.</p>
<div class="note"><p>By default <code>form_with</code> submits forms using Ajax thereby skipping full page redirects. To make this guide easier to get into we've disabled that with <code>local: true</code> for now.</p></div>
<h3 id="creating-articles"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-articles">5.3 Creating articles</a></h3>
<p>To make the "Unknown action" go away, you can define a <code>create</code> action within the <code>ArticlesController</code> class in <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>, underneath the <code>new</code> action, as shown:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end

  def create
  end
end</pre>  <p>If you re-submit the form now, you may not see any change on the page. Don't worry! This is because Rails by default returns <code>204 No Content</code> response for an action if we don't specify what the response should be. We just added the <code>create</code> action but didn't specify anything about how the response should be. In this case, the <code>create</code> action should save our new article to the database.</p>
<p>When a form is submitted, the fields of the form are sent to Rails as <em>parameters</em>. These parameters can then be referenced inside the controller actions, typically to perform a particular task. To see what these parameters look like, change the <code>create</code> action to this:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def create
  render plain: params[:article].inspect
end</pre>  <p>The <code>render</code> method here is taking a very simple hash with a key of <code>:plain</code> and value of <code>params[:article].inspect</code>. The <code>params</code> method is the object which represents the parameters (or fields) coming in from the form. The <code>params</code> method returns an <code>ActionController::Parameters</code> object, which allows you to access the keys of the hash using either strings or symbols. In this situation, the only parameters that matter are the ones from the form.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Ensure you have a firm grasp of the <code>params</code> method, as you'll use it fairly regularly. Let's consider an example URL: <strong><a href="http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&amp;email=dhh@email.com">http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&amp;email=dhh@email.com</a></strong>. In this URL, <code>params[:username]</code> would equal "dhh" and <code>params[:email]</code> would equal "<a href="mailto:dhh@email.com">dhh@email.com</a>".</p></div>
<p>If you re-submit the form one more time, you'll see something that looks like the following:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;ActionController::Parameters {"title"=&gt;"First Article!", "text"=&gt;"This is my first article."} permitted: false&gt;</pre>  <p>This action is now displaying the parameters for the article that are coming in from the form. However, this isn't really all that helpful. Yes, you can see the parameters but nothing in particular is being done with them.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-article-model"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-the-article-model">5.4 Creating the Article model</a></h3>
<p>Models in Rails use a singular name, and their corresponding database tables use a plural name. Rails provides a generator for creating models, which most Rails developers tend to use when creating new models. To create the new model, run this command in your terminal:</p> <pre>$ rails generate model Article title:string text:text</pre>  <p>With that command we told Rails that we want an <code>Article</code> model, together with a <em>title</em> attribute of type string, and a <em>text</em> attribute of type text. Those attributes are automatically added to the <code>articles</code> table in the database and mapped to the <code>Article</code> model.</p>
<p>Rails responded by creating a bunch of files. For now, we're only interested in <code>app/models/article.rb</code> and <code>db/migrate/20140120191729_create_articles.rb</code> (your name could be a bit different). The latter is responsible for creating the database structure, which is what we'll look at next.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Active Record is smart enough to automatically map column names to model attributes, which means you don't have to declare attributes inside Rails models, as that will be done automatically by Active Record.</p></div>
<h3 id="running-a-migration"><a class="anchorlink" href="#running-a-migration">5.5 Running a Migration</a></h3>
<p>As we've just seen, <code>rails generate model</code> created a <em>database migration</em> file inside the <code>db/migrate</code> directory. Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. Rails uses rake commands to run migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.</p>
<p>If you look in the <code>db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_articles.rb</code> file (remember, yours will have a slightly different name), here's what you'll find:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class CreateArticles &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :text

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end</pre>  <p>The above migration creates a method named <code>change</code> which will be called when you run this migration. The action defined in this method is also reversible, which means Rails knows how to reverse the change made by this migration, in case you want to reverse it later. When you run this migration it will create an <code>articles</code> table with one string column and a text column. It also creates two timestamp fields to allow Rails to track article creation and update times.</p>
<div class="info"><p>For more information about migrations, refer to <a href="active_record_migrations">Active Record Migrations</a>.</p></div>
<p>At this point, you can use a rails command to run the migration:</p> <pre>$ rails db:migrate</pre>  <p>Rails will execute this migration command and tell you it created the Articles table.</p> <pre>==  CreateArticles: migrating ==================================================
-- create_table(:articles)
   -&gt; 0.0019s
==  CreateArticles: migrated (0.0020s) =========================================</pre>  <div class="note"><p>Because you're working in the development environment by default, this command will apply to the database defined in the <code>development</code> section of your <code>config/database.yml</code> file. If you would like to execute migrations in another environment, for instance in production, you must explicitly pass it when invoking the command: <code>rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code>.</p></div>
<h3 id="saving-data-in-the-controller"><a class="anchorlink" href="#saving-data-in-the-controller">5.6 Saving data in the controller</a></h3>
<p>Back in <code>ArticlesController</code>, we need to change the <code>create</code> action to use the new <code>Article</code> model to save the data in the database. Open <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> and change the <code>create</code> action to look like this:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def create
  @article = Article.new(params[:article])

  @article.save
  redirect_to @article
end</pre>  <p>Here's what's going on: every Rails model can be initialized with its respective attributes, which are automatically mapped to the respective database columns. In the first line we do just that (remember that <code>params[:article]</code> contains the attributes we're interested in). Then, <code>@article.save</code> is responsible for saving the model in the database. Finally, we redirect the user to the <code>show</code> action, which we'll define later.</p>
<div class="info"><p>You might be wondering why the <code>A</code> in <code>Article.new</code> is capitalized above, whereas most other references to articles in this guide have used lowercase. In this context, we are referring to the class named <code>Article</code> that is defined in <code>app/models/article.rb</code>. Class names in Ruby must begin with a capital letter.</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>As we'll see later, <code>@article.save</code> returns a boolean indicating whether the article was saved or not.</p></div>
<p>If you now go to <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> you'll <em>almost</em> be able to create an article. Try it! You should get an error that looks like this:</p>

<p>Rails has several security features that help you write secure applications, and you're running into one of them now. This one is called <a href="action_controller_overview#strong-parameters">strong parameters</a>, which requires us to tell Rails exactly which parameters are allowed into our controller actions.</p>
<p>Why do you have to bother? The ability to grab and automatically assign all controller parameters to your model in one shot makes the programmer's job easier, but this convenience also allows malicious use. What if a request to the server was crafted to look like a new article form submit but also included extra fields with values that violated your application's integrity? They would be 'mass assigned' into your model and then into the database along with the good stuff - potentially breaking your application or worse.</p>
<p>We have to define our permitted controller parameters to prevent wrongful mass assignment. In this case, we want to both allow and require the <code>title</code> and <code>text</code> parameters for valid use of <code>create</code>. The syntax for this introduces <code>require</code> and <code>permit</code>. The change will involve one line in the <code>create</code> action:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text))</pre>  <p>This is often factored out into its own method so it can be reused by multiple actions in the same controller, for example <code>create</code> and <code>update</code>. Above and beyond mass assignment issues, the method is often made <code>private</code> to make sure it can't be called outside its intended context. Here is the result:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  @article.save
  redirect_to @article
end

private
  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)
  end</pre>  <div class="info"><p>For more information, refer to the reference above and <a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/21/strong-parameters/">this blog article about Strong Parameters</a>.</p></div>
<h3 id="showing-articles"><a class="anchorlink" href="#showing-articles">5.7 Showing Articles</a></h3>
<p>If you submit the form again now, Rails will complain about not finding the <code>show</code> action. That's not very useful though, so let's add the <code>show</code> action before proceeding.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the output of <code>rails routes</code>, the route for <code>show</code> action is as follows:</p> <pre>article GET    /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#show</pre>  <p>The special syntax <code>:id</code> tells rails that this route expects an <code>:id</code> parameter, which in our case will be the id of the article.</p>
<p>As we did before, we need to add the <code>show</code> action in <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> and its respective view.</p>
<div class="note"><p>A frequent practice is to place the standard CRUD actions in each controller in the following order: <code>index</code>, <code>show</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>update</code> and <code>destroy</code>. You may use any order you choose, but keep in mind that these are public methods; as mentioned earlier in this guide, they must be placed before declaring <code>private</code> visibility in the controller.</p></div>
<p>Given that, let's add the <code>show</code> action, as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def new
  end

  # snippet for brevity</pre>  <p>A couple of things to note. We use <code>Article.find</code> to find the article we're interested in, passing in <code>params[:id]</code> to get the <code>:id</code> parameter from the request. We also use an instance variable (prefixed with <code>@</code>) to hold a reference to the article object. We do this because Rails will pass all instance variables to the view.</p>
<p>Now, create a new file <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> with the following content:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>  <p>With this change, you should finally be able to create new articles. Visit <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> and give it a try!</p>

<h3 id="listing-all-articles"><a class="anchorlink" href="#listing-all-articles">5.8 Listing all articles</a></h3>
<p>We still need a way to list all our articles, so let's do that. The route for this as per output of <code>rails routes</code> is:</p> <pre>articles GET    /articles(.:format)          articles#index</pre>  <p>Add the corresponding <code>index</code> action for that route inside the <code>ArticlesController</code> in the <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> file. When we write an <code>index</code> action, the usual practice is to place it as the first method in the controller. Let's do it:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def new
  end

  # snippet for brevity</pre>  <p>And then finally, add the view for this action, located at <code>app/views/articles/index.html.erb</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;Listing articles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;% @articles.each do |article| %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.text %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>  <p>Now if you go to <span>http://localhost:3000/articles</span> you will see a list of all the articles that you have created.</p>
<h3 id="adding-links"><a class="anchorlink" href="#adding-links">5.9 Adding links</a></h3>
<p>You can now create, show, and list articles. Now let's add some links to navigate through pages.</p>
<p>Open <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code> and modify it as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Rails!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;%= link_to 'My Blog', controller: 'articles' %&gt;</pre>  <p>The <code>link_to</code> method is one of Rails' built-in view helpers. It creates a hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case, to the path for articles.</p>
<p>Let's add links to the other views as well, starting with adding this "New Article" link to <code>app/views/articles/index.html.erb</code>, placing it above the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>This link will allow you to bring up the form that lets you create a new article.</p>
<p>Now, add another link in <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code>, underneath the form, to go back to the <code>index</code> action:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with scope: :article, url: articles_path, local: true do |form| %&gt;
  ...
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>Finally, add a link to the <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> template to go back to the <code>index</code> action as well, so that people who are viewing a single article can go back and view the whole list again:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <div class="info"><p>If you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the <code>:controller</code> option, as Rails will use the current controller by default.</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>In development mode (which is what you're working in by default), Rails reloads your application with every browser request, so there's no need to stop and restart the web server when a change is made.</p></div>
<h3 id="adding-some-validation"><a class="anchorlink" href="#adding-some-validation">5.10 Adding Some Validation</a></h3>
<p>The model file, <code>app/models/article.rb</code> is about as simple as it can get:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord
end</pre>  <p>There isn't much to this file - but note that the <code>Article</code> class inherits from <code>ApplicationRecord</code>. <code>ApplicationRecord</code> inherits from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> which supplies a great deal of functionality to your Rails models for free, including basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations, data validation, as well as sophisticated search support and the ability to relate multiple models to one another.</p>
<p>Rails includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models. Open the <code>app/models/article.rb</code> file and edit it:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true,
                    length: { minimum: 5 }
end</pre>  <p>These changes will ensure that all articles have a title that is at least five characters long. Rails can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects. Validations are covered in detail in <a href="active_record_validations">Active Record Validations</a>.</p>
<p>With the validation now in place, when you call <code>@article.save</code> on an invalid article, it will return <code>false</code>. If you open <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> again, you'll notice that we don't check the result of calling <code>@article.save</code> inside the <code>create</code> action. If <code>@article.save</code> fails in this situation, we need to show the form back to the user. To do this, change the <code>new</code> and <code>create</code> actions inside <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> to these:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def new
  @article = Article.new
end

def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  if @article.save
    redirect_to @article
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end

private
  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)
  end</pre>  <p>The <code>new</code> action is now creating a new instance variable called <code>@article</code>, and you'll see why that is in just a few moments.</p>
<p>Notice that inside the <code>create</code> action we use <code>render</code> instead of <code>redirect_to</code> when <code>save</code> returns <code>false</code>. The <code>render</code> method is used so that the <code>@article</code> object is passed back to the <code>new</code> template when it is rendered. This rendering is done within the same request as the form submission, whereas the <code>redirect_to</code> will tell the browser to issue another request.</p>
<p>If you reload <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span> and try to save an article without a title, Rails will send you back to the form, but that's not very useful. You need to tell the user that something went wrong. To do that, you'll modify <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code> to check for error messages:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with scope: :article, url: articles_path, local: true do |form| %&gt;

  &lt;% if @article.errors.any? %&gt;
    &lt;div id="error_explanation"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;
        &lt;%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, "error") %&gt; prohibited
        this article from being saved:
      &lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= msg %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;% end %&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :title %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :text %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :text %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>A few things are going on. We check if there are any errors with <code>@article.errors.any?</code>, and in that case we show a list of all errors with <code>@article.errors.full_messages</code>.</p>
<p><code>pluralize</code> is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be automatically pluralized.</p>
<p>The reason why we added <code>@article = Article.new</code> in the <code>ArticlesController</code> is that otherwise <code>@article</code> would be <code>nil</code> in our view, and calling <code>@article.errors.any?</code> would throw an error.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Rails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with class <code>field_with_errors</code>. You can define a CSS rule to make them standout.</p></div>
<p>Now you'll get a nice error message when saving an article without a title when you attempt to do just that on the new article form <span>http://localhost:3000/articles/new</span>:</p>

<h3 id="updating-articles"><a class="anchorlink" href="#updating-articles">5.11 Updating Articles</a></h3>
<p>We've covered the "CR" part of CRUD. Now let's focus on the "U" part, updating articles.</p>
<p>The first step we'll take is adding an <code>edit</code> action to the <code>ArticlesController</code>, generally between the <code>new</code> and <code>create</code> actions, as shown:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def new
  @article = Article.new
end

def edit
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
end

def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  if @article.save
    redirect_to @article
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end</pre>  <p>The view will contain a form similar to the one we used when creating new articles. Create a file called <code>app/views/articles/edit.html.erb</code> and make it look as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;Edit article&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;%= form_with(model: @article, local: true) do |form| %&gt;

  &lt;% if @article.errors.any? %&gt;
    &lt;div id="error_explanation"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;
        &lt;%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, "error") %&gt; prohibited
        this article from being saved:
      &lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= msg %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;% end %&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :title %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :text %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :text %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>This time we point the form to the <code>update</code> action, which is not defined yet but will be very soon.</p>
<p>Passing the article object to the <code>form_with</code> method will automatically set the URL for submitting the edited article form. This option tells Rails that we want this form to be submitted via the <code>PATCH</code> HTTP method, which is the HTTP method you're expected to use to <strong>update</strong> resources according to the REST protocol.</p>
<p>Also, passing a model object to <code>form_with</code>, like <code>model: @article</code> in the edit view above, will cause form helpers to fill in form fields with the corresponding values of the object. Passing in a symbol scope such as <code>scope: :article</code>, as was done in the new view, only creates empty form fields. More details can be found in <a href="https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with">form_with documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create the <code>update</code> action in <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>. Add it between the <code>create</code> action and the <code>private</code> method:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  if @article.save
    redirect_to @article
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end

def update
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])

  if @article.update(article_params)
    redirect_to @article
  else
    render 'edit'
  end
end

private
  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)
  end</pre>  <p>The new method, <code>update</code>, is used when you want to update a record that already exists, and it accepts a hash containing the attributes that you want to update. As before, if there was an error updating the article we want to show the form back to the user.</p>
<p>We reuse the <code>article_params</code> method that we defined earlier for the create action.</p>
<div class="info"><p>It is not necessary to pass all the attributes to <code>update</code>. For example, if <code>@article.update(title: 'A new title')</code> was called, Rails would only update the <code>title</code> attribute, leaving all other attributes untouched.</p></div>
<p>Finally, we want to show a link to the <code>edit</code> action in the list of all the articles, so let's add that now to <code>app/views/articles/index.html.erb</code> to make it appear next to the "Show" link:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="2"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;% @articles.each do |article| %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.text %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>  <p>And we'll also add one to the <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> template as well, so that there's also an "Edit" link on an article's page. Add this at the bottom of the template:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">...

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>And here's how our app looks so far:</p>

<h3 id="using-partials-to-clean-up-duplication-in-views"><a class="anchorlink" href="#using-partials-to-clean-up-duplication-in-views">5.12 Using partials to clean up duplication in views</a></h3>
<p>Our <code>edit</code> page looks very similar to the <code>new</code> page; in fact, they both share the same code for displaying the form. Let's remove this duplication by using a view partial. By convention, partial files are prefixed with an underscore.</p>
<div class="info"><p>You can read more about partials in the <a href="layouts_and_rendering">Layouts and Rendering in Rails</a> guide.</p></div>
<p>Create a new file <code>app/views/articles/_form.html.erb</code> with the following content:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with model: @article, local: true do |form| %&gt;

  &lt;% if @article.errors.any? %&gt;
    &lt;div id="error_explanation"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;
        &lt;%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, "error") %&gt; prohibited
        this article from being saved:
      &lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;% @article.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= msg %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;% end %&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :title %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :title %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :text %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :text %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>  <p>Everything except for the <code>form_with</code> declaration remained the same. The reason we can use this shorter, simpler <code>form_with</code> declaration to stand in for either of the other forms is that <code>@article</code> is a <em>resource</em> corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes, and Rails is able to infer which URI and method to use. For more information about this use of <code>form_with</code>, see <a href="https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with-label-Resource-oriented+style">Resource-oriented style</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's update the <code>app/views/articles/new.html.erb</code> view to use this new partial, rewriting it completely:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;New article&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;%= render 'form' %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>Then do the same for the <code>app/views/articles/edit.html.erb</code> view:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;Edit article&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;%= render 'form' %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <h3 id="deleting-articles"><a class="anchorlink" href="#deleting-articles">5.13 Deleting Articles</a></h3>
<p>We're now ready to cover the "D" part of CRUD, deleting articles from the database. Following the REST convention, the route for deleting articles as per output of <code>rails routes</code> is:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)      articles#destroy</pre>  <p>The <code>delete</code> routing method should be used for routes that destroy resources. If this was left as a typical <code>get</code> route, it could be possible for people to craft malicious URLs like this:</p> <pre data-language="xml">&lt;a href='http://example.com/articles/1/destroy'&gt;look at this cat!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>  <p>We use the <code>delete</code> method for destroying resources, and this route is mapped to the <code>destroy</code> action inside <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>, which doesn't exist yet. The <code>destroy</code> method is generally the last CRUD action in the controller, and like the other public CRUD actions, it must be placed before any <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> methods. Let's add it:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">def destroy
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  @article.destroy

  redirect_to articles_path
end</pre>  <p>The complete <code>ArticlesController</code> in the <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code> file should now look like this:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def new
    @article = Article.new
  end

  def edit
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)

    if @article.save
      redirect_to @article
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end

  def update
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])

    if @article.update(article_params)
      redirect_to @article
    else
      render 'edit'
    end
  end

  def destroy
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    @article.destroy

    redirect_to articles_path
  end

  private
    def article_params
      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :text)
    end
end</pre>  <p>You can call <code>destroy</code> on Active Record objects when you want to delete them from the database. Note that we don't need to add a view for this action since we're redirecting to the <code>index</code> action.</p>
<p>Finally, add a 'Destroy' link to your <code>index</code> action template (<code>app/views/articles/index.html.erb</code>) to wrap everything together.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;h1&gt;Listing Articles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="3"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;% @articles.each do |article| %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= article.text %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', article_path(article) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(article) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Destroy', article_path(article),
              method: :delete,
              data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>  <p>Here we're using <code>link_to</code> in a different way. We pass the named route as the second argument, and then the options as another argument. The <code>method: :delete</code> and <code>data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' }</code> options are used as HTML5 attributes so that when the link is clicked, Rails will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link with method <code>delete</code>. This is done via the JavaScript file <code>rails-ujs</code> which is automatically included in your application's layout (<code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code>) when you generated the application. Without this file, the confirmation dialog box won't appear.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Learn more about Unobtrusive JavaScript on <a href="working_with_javascript_in_rails">Working With JavaScript in Rails</a> guide.</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, you can now create, show, list, update, and destroy articles.</p>
<div class="info"><p>In general, Rails encourages using resources objects instead of declaring routes manually. For more information about routing, see <a href="routing">Rails Routing from the Outside In</a>.</p></div>
<h2 id="adding-a-second-model"><a class="anchorlink" href="#adding-a-second-model">6 Adding a Second Model</a></h2>
<p>It's time to add a second model to the application. The second model will handle comments on articles.</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-model"><a class="anchorlink" href="#generating-a-model">6.1 Generating a Model</a></h3>
<p>We're going to see the same generator that we used before when creating the <code>Article</code> model. This time we'll create a <code>Comment</code> model to hold a reference to an article. Run this command in your terminal:</p> <pre>$ rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references</pre>  <p>This command will generate four files:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>File</th> <th>Purpose</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>db/migrate/20140120201010_create_comments.rb</td> <td>Migration to create the comments table in your database (your name will include a different timestamp)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>app/models/comment.rb</td> <td>The Comment model</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test/models/comment_test.rb</td> <td>Testing harness for the comment model</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test/fixtures/comments.yml</td> <td>Sample comments for use in testing</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>First, take a look at <code>app/models/comment.rb</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Comment &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :article
end</pre>  <p>This is very similar to the <code>Article</code> model that you saw earlier. The difference is the line <code>belongs_to :article</code>, which sets up an Active Record <em>association</em>. You'll learn a little about associations in the next section of this guide.</p>
<p>The (<code>:references</code>) keyword used in the bash command is a special data type for models. It creates a new column on your database table with the provided model name appended with an <code>_id</code> that can hold integer values. To get a better understanding, analyze the <code>db/schema.rb</code> file after running the migration.</p>
<p>In addition to the model, Rails has also made a migration to create the corresponding database table:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class CreateComments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.string :commenter
      t.text :body
      t.references :article, null: false, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end</pre>  <p>The <code>t.references</code> line creates an integer column called <code>article_id</code>, an index for it, and a foreign key constraint that points to the <code>id</code> column of the <code>articles</code> table. Go ahead and run the migration:</p> <pre>$ rails db:migrate</pre>  <p>Rails is smart enough to only execute the migrations that have not already been run against the current database, so in this case you will just see:</p> <pre>==  CreateComments: migrating =================================================
-- create_table(:comments)
   -&gt; 0.0115s
==  CreateComments: migrated (0.0119s) ========================================</pre>  <h3 id="associating-models"><a class="anchorlink" href="#associating-models">6.2 Associating Models</a></h3>
<p>Active Record associations let you easily declare the relationship between two models. In the case of comments and articles, you could write out the relationships this way:</p> <ul> <li>Each comment belongs to one article.</li> <li>One article can have many comments.</li> </ul> <p>In fact, this is very close to the syntax that Rails uses to declare this association. You've already seen the line of code inside the <code>Comment</code> model (app/models/comment.rb) that makes each comment belong to an Article:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Comment &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :article
end</pre>  <p>You'll need to edit <code>app/models/article.rb</code> to add the other side of the association:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments
  validates :title, presence: true,
                    length: { minimum: 5 }
end</pre>  <p>These two declarations enable a good bit of automatic behavior. For example, if you have an instance variable <code>@article</code> containing an article, you can retrieve all the comments belonging to that article as an array using <code>@article.comments</code>.</p>
<div class="info"><p>For more information on Active Record associations, see the <a href="association_basics">Active Record Associations</a> guide.</p></div>
<h3 id="adding-a-route-for-comments"><a class="anchorlink" href="#adding-a-route-for-comments">6.3 Adding a Route for Comments</a></h3>
<p>As with the <code>welcome</code> controller, we will need to add a route so that Rails knows where we would like to navigate to see <code>comments</code>. Open up the <code>config/routes.rb</code> file again, and edit it as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resources :articles do
  resources :comments
end</pre>  <p>This creates <code>comments</code> as a <em>nested resource</em> within <code>articles</code>. This is another part of capturing the hierarchical relationship that exists between articles and comments.</p>
<div class="info"><p>For more information on routing, see the <a href="routing">Rails Routing</a> guide.</p></div>
<h3 id="generating-a-controller"><a class="anchorlink" href="#generating-a-controller">6.4 Generating a Controller</a></h3>
<p>With the model in hand, you can turn your attention to creating a matching controller. Again, we'll use the same generator we used before:</p> <pre>$ rails generate controller Comments</pre>  <p>This creates four files and one empty directory:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>File/Directory</th> <th>Purpose</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>app/controllers/comments_controller.rb</td> <td>The Comments controller</td> </tr> <tr> <td>app/views/comments/</td> <td>Views of the controller are stored here</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test/controllers/comments_controller_test.rb</td> <td>The test for the controller</td> </tr> <tr> <td>app/helpers/comments_helper.rb</td> <td>A view helper file</td> </tr> <tr> <td>app/assets/stylesheets/comments.scss</td> <td>Cascading style sheet for the controller</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Like with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed. Due to this, our <code>CommentsController</code> is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive.</p>
<p>So first, we'll wire up the Article show template (<code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code>) to let us make a new comment:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add a comment:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= form_with(model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ], local: true) do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :commenter %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :commenter %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :body %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :body %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>This adds a form on the <code>Article</code> show page that creates a new comment by calling the <code>CommentsController</code> <code>create</code> action. The <code>form_with</code> call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as <code>/articles/1/comments</code>.</p>
<p>Let's wire up the <code>create</code> in <code>app/controllers/comments_controller.rb</code>:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)
    redirect_to article_path(@article)
  end

  private
    def comment_params
      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)
    end
end</pre>  <p>You'll see a bit more complexity here than you did in the controller for articles. That's a side-effect of the nesting that you've set up. Each request for a comment has to keep track of the article to which the comment is attached, thus the initial call to the <code>find</code> method of the <code>Article</code> model to get the article in question.</p>
<p>In addition, the code takes advantage of some of the methods available for an association. We use the <code>create</code> method on <code>@article.comments</code> to create and save the comment. This will automatically link the comment so that it belongs to that particular article.</p>
<p>Once we have made the new comment, we send the user back to the original article using the <code>article_path(@article)</code> helper. As we have already seen, this calls the <code>show</code> action of the <code>ArticlesController</code> which in turn renders the <code>show.html.erb</code> template. This is where we want the comment to show, so let's add that to the <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code>.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;% @article.comments.each do |comment| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Commenter:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;%= comment.commenter %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Comment:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;%= comment.body %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add a comment:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= form_with(model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ], local: true) do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :commenter %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :commenter %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :body %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :body %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>Now you can add articles and comments to your blog and have them show up in the right places.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring"><a class="anchorlink" href="#refactoring">7 Refactoring</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have articles and comments working, take a look at the <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> template. It is getting long and awkward. We can use partials to clean it up.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-partial-collections"><a class="anchorlink" href="#rendering-partial-collections">7.1 Rendering Partial Collections</a></h3>
<p>First, we will make a comment partial to extract showing all the comments for the article. Create the file <code>app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb</code> and put the following into it:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Commenter:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= comment.commenter %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Comment:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= comment.body %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>  <p>Then you can change <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> to look like the following:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= render @article.comments %&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add a comment:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= form_with(model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ], local: true) do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :commenter %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :commenter %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :body %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :body %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>This will now render the partial in <code>app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb</code> once for each comment that is in the <code>@article.comments</code> collection. As the <code>render</code> method iterates over the <code>@article.comments</code> collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, in this case <code>comment</code>, which is then available in the partial for us to show.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-a-partial-form"><a class="anchorlink" href="#rendering-a-partial-form">7.2 Rendering a Partial Form</a></h3>
<p>Let us also move that new comment section out to its own partial. Again, you create a file <code>app/views/comments/_form.html.erb</code> containing:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;%= form_with(model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ], local: true) do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :commenter %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :commenter %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :body %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_area :body %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>  <p>Then you make the <code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb</code> look like the following:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= @article.text %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= render @article.comments %&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add a comment:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;%= render 'comments/form' %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %&gt; |
&lt;%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %&gt;</pre>  <p>The second render just defines the partial template we want to render, <code>comments/form</code>. Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the <code>_form.html.erb</code> file in the <code>app/views/comments</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>@article</code> object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable.</p>
<h2 id="deleting-comments"><a class="anchorlink" href="#deleting-comments">8 Deleting Comments</a></h2>
<p>Another important feature of a blog is being able to delete spam comments. To do this, we need to implement a link of some sort in the view and a <code>destroy</code> action in the <code>CommentsController</code>.</p>
<p>So first, let's add the delete link in the <code>app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb</code> partial:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Commenter:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= comment.commenter %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Comment:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;%= comment.body %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to 'Destroy Comment', [comment.article, comment],
               method: :delete,
               data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>  <p>Clicking this new "Destroy Comment" link will fire off a <code>DELETE
/articles/:article_id/comments/:id</code> to our <code>CommentsController</code>, which can then use this to find the comment we want to delete, so let's add a <code>destroy</code> action to our controller (<code>app/controllers/comments_controller.rb</code>):</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)
    redirect_to article_path(@article)
  end

  def destroy
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    @comment = @article.comments.find(params[:id])
    @comment.destroy
    redirect_to article_path(@article)
  end

  private
    def comment_params
      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)
    end
end</pre>  <p>The <code>destroy</code> action will find the article we are looking at, locate the comment within the <code>@article.comments</code> collection, and then remove it from the database and send us back to the show action for the article.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-associated-objects"><a class="anchorlink" href="#deleting-associated-objects">8.1 Deleting Associated Objects</a></h3>
<p>If you delete an article, its associated comments will also need to be deleted, otherwise they would simply occupy space in the database. Rails allows you to use the <code>dependent</code> option of an association to achieve this. Modify the Article model, <code>app/models/article.rb</code>, as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  validates :title, presence: true,
                    length: { minimum: 5 }
end</pre>  <h2 id="security"><a class="anchorlink" href="#security">9 Security</a></h2>
<h3 id="basic-authentication"><a class="anchorlink" href="#basic-authentication">9.1 Basic Authentication</a></h3>
<p>If you were to publish your blog online, anyone would be able to add, edit and delete articles or delete comments.</p>
<p>Rails provides a very simple HTTP authentication system that will work nicely in this situation.</p>
<p>In the <code>ArticlesController</code> we need to have a way to block access to the various actions if the person is not authenticated. Here we can use the Rails <code>http_basic_authenticate_with</code> method, which allows access to the requested action if that method allows it.</p>
<p>To use the authentication system, we specify it at the top of our <code>ArticlesController</code> in <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>. In our case, we want the user to be authenticated on every action except <code>index</code> and <code>show</code>, so we write that:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController

  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", except: [:index, :show]

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  # snippet for brevity</pre>  <p>We also want to allow only authenticated users to delete comments, so in the <code>CommentsController</code> (<code>app/controllers/comments_controller.rb</code>) we write:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController

  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", only: :destroy

  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    # ...
  end

  # snippet for brevity</pre>  <p>Now if you try to create a new article, you will be greeted with a basic HTTP Authentication challenge:</p>

<p>Other authentication methods are available for Rails applications. Two popular authentication add-ons for Rails are the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> rails engine and the <a href="https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">Authlogic</a> gem, along with a number of others.</p>

<p>Security, especially in web applications, is a broad and detailed area. Security in your Rails application is covered in more depth in the <a href="security">Ruby on Rails Security Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to work with Rails is to store all external data as UTF-8. If you don't, Ruby libraries and Rails will often be able to convert your native data into UTF-8, but this doesn't always work reliably, so you're better off ensuring that all external data is UTF-8.</p>
<p>If you have made a mistake in this area, the most common symptom is a black diamond with a question mark inside appearing in the browser. Another common symptom is characters like "Ã¼" appearing instead of "ü". Rails takes a number of internal steps to mitigate common causes of these problems that can be automatically detected and corrected. However, if you have external data that is not stored as UTF-8, it can occasionally result in these kinds of issues that cannot be automatically detected by Rails and corrected.</p>
<p>Two very common sources of data that are not UTF-8:</p> <ul> <li>Your text editor: Most text editors (such as TextMate), default to saving files as UTF-8. If your text editor does not, this can result in special characters that you enter in your templates (such as é) to appear as a diamond with a question mark inside in the browser. This also applies to your i18n translation files. Most editors that do not already default to UTF-8 (such as some versions of Dreamweaver) offer a way to change the default to UTF-8. Do so.</li> <li>Your database: Rails defaults to converting data from your database into UTF-8 at the boundary. However, if your database is not using UTF-8 internally, it may not be able to store all characters that your users enter. For instance, if your database is using Latin-1 internally, and your user enters a Russian, Hebrew, or Japanese character, the data will be lost forever once it enters the database. If possible, use UTF-8 as the internal storage of your database.</li> </ul> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p> You're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide. </p> <p> Please contribute if you see any typos or factual errors.
